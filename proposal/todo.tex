\begin{enumerate}
\item Combine deep and shallow migratory typing in a model; formulate and prove safety properties.
\item Implement the model via a Shallow Typed Racket; re-use the Typed Racket type system.
\item Compare the performance of the combined language to Typed Racket + Racket.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Challenge 1: Model}

We need a model that combines deep and shallow migratory typing.
The model must allow the definition of deep-typed code, shallow-typed code, and untyped code.
All three must be able to interact.

The primary goal of the model is to state and prove safety properties for each kind of type.
Deep types must be trustworthy in any context.
Shallow types must match the type-tag of values in shallow-typed contexts.
If the safety properties depend on any new extensions, the model must make these clear.
For example, shallow-typed code may need to accept proxied values from deep-typed code.

% primary = implementable?

A secondary goal of the model is to realize safety with few run-time checks.
We plan to identify methods that may (and may not) be used to reduce the necessary run-time checks.
Time-permitting, we plan to explore promising methods in the implementation.
