\begin{enumerate}
\item Combine deep, shallow, and erasure in a model language; formulate and prove safety properties.
\item Implement the model via a Shallow Typed Racket; re-use the Typed Racket type system.
\item Compare the performance of the combined language to Typed Racket + Racket.
\end{enumerate}
