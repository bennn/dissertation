The literature on migratory typing presents many strategies for
 mixing typed and untyped code.
Two strategies, \emph{natural}\/ and \emph{transient}\/, are especially
 interesting because they guarantee type soundness and do not limit the
 expressiveness of untyped code.
Despite these commonalities, however, the strategies offer vastly different
 guarantees and performance tradeoffs.
Their complementary strengths suggest the need for a combination.

My work to date has developed novel methods for understanding the semantics
 and performance of migratory typing systems.
I propose to leverage this expertise to:
 (1) design a semantics that supports interoperability between natural and transient,
 (2) implement the semantics,
 and (3) systematically evaluate the performance of the combination.
