The literature on migratory typing presents many strategies for
 mixing typed and untyped code.
Two strategies are especially interesting because they
 guarantee type soundness and do not limit the expressiveness of untyped code;
 these strategies are known as \emph{natural}\/ and \emph{transient}\/.
Despite these commonalities, however, the strategies offer vastly different
 guarantees and performance tradeoffs.
Their complementary strengths suggest the need for a combination.

My work to date has developed novel methods for understanding the semantics
 and performance of migratory typing systems.
I propose to leverage this expertise to: design a semantics that supports
 interoperability between natural and transient,
 implement the semantics,
 and systematically evaluate the performance of the combination.
