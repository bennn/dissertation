% Are lying types an acceptable compromise for migratory typing?
%% says nothing about interactions!

The existence of two approaches to run-time type enforcement,
 each with competing advantages, raises a natural thesis question:

\begin{quote}
  \emph{Does migratory typing benefit from a combination of \tdeep{} and \tshallow{} types?}
%% well ... we mean a particular combination with some angelic guidance from the programmer
\end{quote}

This one question rests on two sub-questions.
Can \tdeep{} and \tshallow{} types be combined?
Does the combination offer any benefit over either individually?
