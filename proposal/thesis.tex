% Are lying types an acceptable compromise for migratory typing?
%% says nothing about interactions!

% We are interested in general-purpose migratory typing systems that offer a
%  non-trivial type soundness guarantee.
% Concrete types are out because they limit the expressiveness of untyped code,
%  and really only make sense in a nominal object-oriented language, in which
%  every value is an instance of a class and every class has a type.
% Erased types are out because they lack type soundness.
% Hence we focus on natural and transient.

  \emph{Does migratory typing benefit from a combination of \tdeep{} and \tshallow{} types?}
%% well ... we mean a particular combination with some angelic guidance from the programmer
\end{quote}

We plan to explore a combination of the natural and transient approaches to
 run-time type enforcement within one migratory typing system.
In the combined system, each component in a program shall be either:
 dynamically-typed,
 statically-typed with natural type enforcement,
 or statically-typed with transient type enforcement.
Both variants of static typing shall employ the same language of types and the
 same type checker.
Honest types must continue to be honest (\sectionref{sec:done})
 and lying types must continue to be tag-sound (\sectionref{sec:done}).

Beyond these requirements, the thesis question leaves room for exploration.
In particular, two sub-questions must be addressed.
The first is \emph{how to combine}\/ honest and lying
 types in a way that preserves their respective guarantees.
The second is \emph{how to measure the benefit}\/ of the combination.
\Sectionref{sec:todo} outlines criteria and proposes solutions.
