% Are lying types an acceptable compromise for migratory typing?
%% says nothing about interactions!

% We are interested in general-purpose migratory typing systems that offer a
%  non-trivial type soundness guarantee.
% Concrete types are out because they limit the expressiveness of untyped code,
%  and really only make sense in a nominal object-oriented language, in which
%  every value is an instance of a class and every class has a type.
% Erased types are out because they lack type soundness.
% Hence we focus on natural and transient.

  \emph{Does migratory typing benefit from a combination of \tdeep{} and \tshallow{} types?}
%% well ... we mean a particular combination with some angelic guidance from the programmer
\end{quote}

We plan to explore a combination of the natural and transient approaches to
 run-time type enforcement within one migratory typing system.
In the combined system, each component in a program shall be either:
 dynamically-typed,
 statically-typed with natural type enforcement,
 or statically-typed with transient type enforcement.
Both variants of static typing shall employ the same language of types and the
 same type checker.
Honest types must continue to be honest
 and lying types must continue to be tag-sound
 in the formal sense described in \sectionref{sec:done}.

Beyond these requirements, the thesis question leaves room for exploration.
In particular, two sub-questions must be addressed.
The first is \emph{how to combine}\/ honest and lying
 types in a way that preserves their respective guarantees.
The second is \emph{how to measure the performance benefit}\/ of the combination.
\Sectionref{sec:todo} outlines criteria and proposes solutions.
