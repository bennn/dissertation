If all goes well, I plan to finish the research in six months.
I plan to spend three months writing a dissertation.

The following table presents a plan for \emph{when to begin}\/ different tasks.
The initial goal is a combined model; I propose one month to work out the
 basics, and part-time work to finish the details.
Work on the implementation will begin once the model is in a promising state.
I plan to start measuring performance in the early spring;
 preliminary results may change the focus of the model.
Dissertation-writing can begin concurrently with the performance
 evaluation.
