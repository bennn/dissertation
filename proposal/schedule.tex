If all goes well, we plan to finish the research in six months and to spend two
 months writing a dissertation.
In case of setbacks, we propose four months of extra time.

The following table presents a plan for \emph{when to begin}\/ different tasks.
The initial goal is a combined model; we propose one month to work out the
 basics, and part-time work to finish the details.
Work on the implementation will begin once the model is in a promising state.
We plan to start measuring performance in the early spring;
 preliminary results may change the focus of the model.
Dissertation-writing can begin concurrently with part of the performance
 evaluation.
