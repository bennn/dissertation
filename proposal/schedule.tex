There are four major tasks ahead:
  develop a model,
  build an implementation,
  evaluate the implementation,
  and write a dissertation.
I additionally plan to write a research paper about the model and
 implementation.

Work on the model can begin immediately.
By the end of this year, it should be clear whether the model can support
 an implementation.
Implementation work must begin with a review of the existing
 \tshallow{}-typed Racket system~\cite{gf-icfp-2018};
 I have already started this update, and plan to continue working in parallel
 with the modeling.
Evaluations will begin as soon as the implementation can support simple
 benchmarks.
These preliminary measurements shall inform the protocol for a final
 performance evaluation.
The evaluation will take several weeks to finish;
 as the evaluation is running, I plan to write a research report on the
 combined system.
The dissertation will combine this report with my other findings on
 migratory typing.
I plan to defend my dissertation during the Fall 2020 semester.
