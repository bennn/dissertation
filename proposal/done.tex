My research to date has focused on
 understanding the performance challenges for natural
 and comparing natural to other approaches.
The performance efforts have shown that a combination of natural
 and transient is worth exploring.
The comparison efforts have produced a theoretical model for the combined
 language.

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}

I began my Ph.D. studies in Fall 2014.
At this time, Typed Racket was a mature implementation of natural-style
 migratory typing.
Its type system understood compositional type tests (via occurrence typing),
 variable-arity polymorphism,
 delimited continuations,
 first-class structural classes,
 and many idioms specific to Racket programs.
Its compiler could optimize-away safety checks thanks to the static types.
It shipped with the Racket main distribution.
And lastly, it came with a base environment of useful types for many core
 libraries.

Programmers had begun using Typed Racket in various applications.
A few programmers noticed, however, that types could slow code down.
Messages appeared on the Racket mailing list documenting overheads
 of TODO and even TODO in typed code.
Invariably, these typed modules mixed with untyped code.

Prior work on Typed Racket had acknowledged that the performance of mixed-typed
 programs could be an issue.
Users experiences affirmed that performance was a crucial issue.

As a first step, \citeN{Tecoop} proposed an exhaustive method of performance
 evaluation: for a program with $N$ modules, measure the $2^N$ combinations in
 which each module is typed or untyped.
They applied this method to two object-oriented programs and noted the need
 for a deeper study~\cite{stop}.
My first task as a Ph.D. student was thus to analyze Typed Racket.
