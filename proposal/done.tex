My research to date has focused on
 understanding the performance challenges for natural
 and comparing natural to other approaches.
These efforts have led up to the above thesis question.
The performance studies motivate a combination of \tdeep{} and \tshallow{}
 types, and suggest methods to empirically validate the result.
The comparison studies provide a theoretical model for defining the
 combination and understanding its formal guarantees.


\subsection{Performance Evaluation}

I began my Ph.D. studies in Fall 2014.
At this time, Typed Racket was a mature implementation of natural-style
 migratory typing.
Its type system understood compositional type tests (via occurrence typing),
 variable-arity polymorphism,
 delimited continuations,
 first-class structural classes,
 and many idioms specific to Racket programs.
Its compiler could optimize-away safety checks thanks to the static types.
It shipped with the Racket main distribution.
And it came with a base environment of useful types for many core
 libraries.

Programmers had begun using Typed Racket in various applications.
A few programmers noticed, however, that types could slow code down.
Messages appeared on the Racket mailing list documenting overheads
 of TODO and even TODO in typed code.
Invariably, these typed modules mixed with untyped code.

Prior work on Typed Racket had acknowledged that the performance of mixed-typed
 programs could be an issue.
Users experiences affirmed that performance was a crucial issue.
My first task as a Ph.D. student was thus to develop a method to assess the
 performance impact of a migratory typing system.


\subsubsection{Exhaustive Method}

In 2015, \citeN{ecoop} measured the performance impact of gradual typing on
 two object-oriented programs.
Their key insight was to begin with a fully-typed program and measure the
 running time of all gradually-typed configurations obtained by removing
 some type annotations.
By working backwards from the types, the method lets a researcher systematically
 visit the codes that a programmer may encounter as they migrate an
 application.
By measuring all configurations, the method enables general claims about
 migratory typing---which, after all, advertises the freedom to mix typed
 and untyped code.

This method for collecting data motivated a larger study~\cite{stop}.
I helped develop (and measure) 12 functional benchmark programs, ranging in
 size from 30 to 6,000 lines of code, for an evaluation of Typed
 Racket~\cite{popl}.

During the evaluation, it became clear that the data analysis was a major
 issue.
The first evaluation~\cite{ecoop} had studied two program of four modules each
 and presented the results in two powerset lattices of $2^4$ configurations.
This visualization method was impractical for programs with seven or more
 module.
The typical ``summary statistics'' of mean, median, min, and max were also a
 poor fit; although worst-case performance could be terrible
 (\figureref{fig:max-overhead}), there is no guarantee that a programmer
 will actually encounter the worst case.

To summarize our exponentially-large datasets, we formulated the notion
 of a \deliverable{D} configuration.
A mixed-typed configuration is \deliverable{D} if it runs at most $D$ times
 slower than a fully-untyped baseline configuration.
For programmers, the relevant question is what percent of all configurations
 are \deliverable{D} for a few critical values.
If a team is willing to accept a 6x slowdown due to migratory typing,
 and the percent of \deliverable{6} configurations is above 90\% on a suite
 of representative benchmarks, then they may conclude that new types are
 unlikely to break their performance goal.

Our 2016 paper~\cite{todo} plots the proportion of \deliverable{D} configurations
 for $D$ between 1x and 20x.
The results gave an extremely negative image of natural-style migratory typing;
 in half the benchmarks, fewer than 60\% of all configurations were
 \deliverable{20}.
The plots also explored whether adding types to two additional modules could
 improve performance in the best case.
Unfortunately, the extra conversions steps could not guarantee a drastic
 performance improvement.
For example, the plots in \figureref{fig:snake-popl} show the percent of
 \deliverable{D} configurations allowing 0, 1, and 2 extra conversion steps.
Even in the rightmost plot, allowing 2 angelic conversion steps, there are
 still many (~20\%) configurations that run 10 times slower than the baseline.

         $60$\% of all configs.

\label{fig:snake-popl}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Measuring Improvements}

The evaluation of Typed Racket inspired many efforts to improve its performance.
Sam Tobin-Hochstadt fixed issues in Typed Racket and modified it to produce
 simpler contracts for common function shapes.
Robert Bruce Findler greatly reduced the allocation costs of Racket contracts.
Others, including myself, contributed smaller patches.

All told, Typed Racket changed significantly between versions 6.2 (June 2015)
 and 6.4 (February 2016).
The evaluation method quantified the effect of these changes on
 performance with plot containing multiple \deliverable{D} curves on the same
 axis~\cite{gtnffvf-jfp-2019}.
To demonstrate, \figureref{fig:snake-jfp} presents curves for the \bm{snake}
 benchmark on Racket 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.
The curve for version 6.4 lies above the others, meaning the percent of
 \deliverable{D} configurations is increased for every value of $D$ along
 the $x$ axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{src/snake-jfp.png}
\caption{Comparing performance across three versions of Typed Racket}
\label{fig:snake-jfp}
\end{figure}

Daniel Feltey later contributed a major change to the contract system:
 collapsible higher-order contracts~\cite{fgsfs-oopsla-2018}.
Once again, the exhaustive evaluation method was one of the ways that we
 measured the impact of the new contracts.


\subsubsection{Approximate Method}

Concurrently with the improvements to Typed Racket, Zeina Migeed and I
 adapted the evaluation method to Transient Reticulated Python~\cite{gm-pepm-2018}.
This proved challenging because Reticulated allows type annotations
 at a finer granularity than Typed Racket; in particular, any function
 parameter, function return, and class field may have a type annotation.
Additionally, Reticulated changes the behavior of untyped Python code that
 it preprocesses.

For our evaluation, we elected to type entire function and class definitions
 as one ``unit'' of type conversion.
We also added one configuration to the space, with Python running the untyped
 code, as a baseline for comparisons.
In a program with three functions and four classes, we thus explored
 $2^{3+4} + 1$ configurations for the evaluation.

Even this coarse space, however, is too large to evaluate programs with more
 than $20$ functions and classes.
To overcome this practical limitation, we developed a method based on
 simple random sampling to approximate the number of \deliverable{D}
 configurations in a benchmark.
The sampling method counts the percent of \deliverable{D} configurations
 in a few sets of configurations, whose members are chosen uniform-randomly;
 the resulting set of percentages provides a confidence bound for the true
 percent of \deliverable{D} configurations.

We validated the sampling method on six benchmarks with $12$ to $17$ ``unit''
 of type conversion each (consequently, $2^{12}$ to $2^17$ configurations).
For each of these benchmarks, we conducted both an exhaustive evaluation and
 an approximate one; the approximation took $10$ samples with $120$ to $170$
 configurations in each sample.
The $95$\% confidence intervals for the samples yielded tight bounds on the
 true percents of \deliverable{D} configurations for $D$ between $1$x and
 $10$x.
Therefore, we conclude that the method is useful for benchmarks in which we
 cannot obtain ground-truth results in a practical timeframe.
