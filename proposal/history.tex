A migratory typing system adds static types to an existing
dynamically-typed host language~\cite{tfffgksst-snapl-2017}.
At a minimum, the addition requires a static type checker and
syntax to accomodate mixed-typed code.
If the types are intended as claims about the kinds of values that
flow through a program at run-time, then the addition also requires a method
of enforcing types.

Typed Racket~\cite{tf-popl-2008} is one example of a migratory typing system.
The language accepts type-annotated Racket programs,
validates the annotations with a type checker, and enforces the annotations
with a translation of types to higher-order contracts.
For example, \figureref{fig:guess-game} presents a mixed-typed
program consisting of three modules.
The two untyped modules at the top of the figure define a guessing game
and a game player.
The typed module at the bottom gives the player five chances to submit a
correct guess.

The typed driver module assigns a static type to the untyped game and
 game player.
At compile-time, the type checker validates the contents of the driver module
 assuming that the types assigned to these untyped functions are correct.
At run-time, higher-order contracts dynamically enforce the claims of the types.
Thanks to the contracts, these types are kept honest.
If a different player function were to submit a string as a guess, a contract
 violation would halt the program and direct the programmer to the boundary
 between the typed driver and the untyped player.

In theory, Typed Racket gives programmers the ability to freely mix typed and untyped modules.
Imagine a large, untyped codebase;
 its maintainers may add types to any single module while leaving the rest
 untyped to arrive at a new, runnable program~\cite{tf-dls-2006,tf-popl-2008}.
After the conversion, the new module benefits from static type checking,
 which enables type-driven compiler optimizations.

In practice, a programmer's freedom to add types is severly limited by
 the run-time cost of type enforcement~\cite{tfgnvf-popl-2016,gtnffvf-jfp-2019}.
Adding types to one module adds a contract boundary to its neighbors.
These boundaries may add overhead throughout the program.
When two modules communicate through a boundary, they may experience three kinds
 of performance overhead.
First, there is the overhead of checking every value that crosses the
 boundary.
Second, a higher-order boundary must allocate new wrappers to constrain the
 future behavior of any values that cross it.
Third, wrapped values suffer from a layer of indirection.
These overheads can dramatically increase the running time of a program
 (\figureref{fig:max-overhead}).
Clearly, keeping types honest may impose a huge cost.

\subsection{Different Strategies}

Other migratory typing systems do not keep types honest in the
 same manner as Typed Racket.
Some add a runtime invariant to reduce the cost of honest types~\cite{wnlov-popl-2010,bmt-ecoop-2010,mt-oopsla-2017,rat-oopsla-2017}.
Still others choose to selectively enforce types; a value may be obliged to
 satisfy a type in some contexts, but not all~\cite{vss-popl-2017}.
With a few exceptions,\footnote{Like types
 let a programmer toggle between concrete types and erased types~\cite{wnlov-popl-2010,rzv-ecoop-2015}.
 Grace enforces user-supplied type annotations with tag checks~\cite{rmhn-ecoop-2019}.
 Pyret enforces type annotations with tag checks
  for certain types and deep traversals for others (\shorturl{https://www.}{pyret.org}).}
 the different strategies fall into four broad categories:
 natural, concrete, erasure, and transient.

Typed Racket implements the \emph{natural}\/ type enforcement
 strategy~\cite{mf-toplas-2009,tf-popl-2008}.
A natural semantics carefully guards the boundaries between typed and untyped
 code by wrapping higher-order values in proxies and by eagerly
 checking/traversing other data.
For example, if a natural language expects a list of numbers, then it
 checks every element of an incoming list.
If a natural language expects a function, it creates a proxy around an incoming
 function value to protect future inputs and validate future results.
% On one hand, this strategy lets typed code interact with arbitrary values and
%  ensures that every untyped value completely matches all types associated to it.
% On the other hand, it requires many run-time checks.

A \emph{concrete}\/ system comes with two invariants.
First, only statically-typed code can create new values.
Second, every value has an immutable and precise type label.
If a run-time system enforces these invariants, then types can be kept honest
 through inexpensive label checks~\cite{mt-oopsla-2017,wnlov-popl-2010,bmt-ecoop-2010,rat-oopsla-2017}.\footnote{Dart 2 implements concrete types (\shorturl{https://}{dart.dev/dart-2}).}
For example, if a typed function expects a vector of integers and receives
 a value from a dynamically-typed context, the function can check whether the
 value's label is a subtype of the expected type.
This operation is much simpler than traversing and wrapping the vector.

An \emph{erasure}\/ migratory typing system ignores types at run-time~\cite{bat-ecoop-2014,bg-oopsla-1993,s-lisp-1990}.
Typed code benefits from static type checking, but behaves exactly the same
 as untyped code.
Erased types therefore add zero performance overhead, do not enable
 type-driven optimizations, and provide zero feedback
 when statically-typed code receives an input that contradicts the static
 types.
If a typed function receives a bad argument, the application proceeds without
 hesitation and may compute a result that is in conflict with a
 static type and/or the logic of the program.

Lastly, a \emph{transient}\/ migratory typing system partially enforces types
 via tag checks~\cite{vss-popl-2017,v-thesis-2019}.
In typed code, every elimination form and every boundary to untyped code
 is protected with a tag check.
Each tag check matches the top-level shape of a value againt the outermost
 constructor of the expected type.
For example, the tag check for a
 list of numbers accepts any list---no matter the contents.
In untyped code, there are no checks.
Transient types protect typed code from simple
 tag errors such as adding an integer to a function, but they fail
 to protect untyped code from lying types that are not completely checked.

The existence of different approaches indicates a conflict between the theory
 and practice of migratory typing.
Honest types are ideal from a theoretical perspective, but require either
 sophisticated run-time checks or limits on the expressiveness of
 untyped code; \figureref{fig:solution-space} maps potential solutions to
 thise performance challenge.
Erased types are the polar opposite, as they require no run-time support
 and sacrifice all guarantees.
If researchers can do no better than erasure, then
 type-sound migratory typing is a dead end.
I am not yet willing to give up, and I therefore propose to explore a
 compromise semantics---indicated in the right-most part of
 \figureref{fig:solution-space}---based on a careful theoretical exploration of the design space.
