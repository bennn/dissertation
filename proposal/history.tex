Began with a capable implementation of migratory typing; namely, Typed Racket.
That proof-of-concept back in 2006 had matured to support all kinds of Racket programs.
It also clearly had performance troubles, identified by users around the world.

The question was, how bad is performance?
To answer, we developed a method and conducted an evaluation.
The results were quite bad, inspired a lot of improvements, and are still a challenge today.

Meanwhile, other groups explored migratory typing in other contexts.
Transient Reticulated particularly interesting.
We adapted the evaluation method to Transient.
Findings --- on completely different benchmarks --- were encouraging in a big (order of magnitude) way.

Compared Transient style to Typed Racket style on Racket programs.
Performance results confirm findings from the Transient-alone study.

Developed models to state and prove properties for each.
Different type soundness!
Whats more, different about trusting the types.
TR-style is a complete monitor but Transient-style is not.
