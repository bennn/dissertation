Ben, final-semester Matthias
studying what types mean in gradual languages
NOT about what gradualized types mean,
 lots of fuss about effects of mixing Dyn
 but all second-order ... usually authors have a meaning in mind and want to achieve
 ... interested in the different meanings
some don't check types at all, TS
 others are sound but in a funny way, Transient
 motivations = performance, but not so cut & dry, expressiveness changes too
working on criteria, CM not TS, and finer distinctions across the design space
with perf, though, motivates a combo semantics
 so working on transient + natural typed racket
 highlights ...
 - theory
 - reuse knowledge? no
 - implementing, several grown idioms to work around
