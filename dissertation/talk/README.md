Ben, final-semester Matthias
studying what types mean in gradual languages
NOT about what gradualized types mean,
 lots of fuss about effects of mixing Dyn
 but all second-order ... usually authors have a meaning in mind and want to achieve
 ... interested in the different meanings
some don't check types at all, TS
 others are sound but in a funny way, Transient
 motivations = performance, but not so cut & dry, expressiveness changes too
working on criteria, CM not TS, and finer distinctions across the design space
with perf, though, motivates a combo semantics
 so working on transient + natural typed racket
 highlights ...
 - theory
 - reuse knowledge? no
 - implementing, several grown idioms to work around

wonderful idea, mixing typed and untyped

huge response ... headlines? promises?
 maybe go like a security talk ... why not its different for me

but hey different behaviors & performance

ben = order to chaos, learned about Deep and Shallow and ways to achieve,
 thesis Q arises

design space ... lead into D S definitions

perf space ... lead into natural and transient
 natural isn't really, have the collapsible contracts in there

thesis revisited, now for unpublished results
 transient racket
 mix, both in theory and practice
