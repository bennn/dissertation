 outline attempt
  (why not chronological?)

 0. honest + lying can coexist, thesis ... quest for practical GT
 1. different semantics, which is best? lacking theory + eval landscape
 2. perf eval, applied to TR + Retic (ignore ICFP)
 3. theory eval, for Guarded + Transient + Erasure + compromises
 4. Guarded + Transient
    - why this pair
    - model
    - evaluation
    - other benefits
 5. threats, other concerns (survey)
 6. related work
 7.
