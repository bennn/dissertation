What bugs did we find and fix in TR and other codebases?

1. check-expect type error
  <https://github.com/racket/htdp/pull/98>
  Ran Transient on typed-racket-test/succeed/check-expect.rkt,
   got error expected Void found Boolean

2. Channel any-wrap
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/919>
  Forget how found ... but Transient was creating unnecessary any-wraps
  A perfect Transient would not have found this bug.

3. Share sc cache
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/917>
  Found by reading core.rkt code

4. Run ignored tests
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/916>
  Found by converting unit tests to Transient (reading all test files)

5. Add any-wrap for hash-top type
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/914>
  Found by reading type-contract.rkt

6. Missing type annotation
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/912>
  Found by defender.rkt, it needs type annotations

7. Make list/sc
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/911>
  Found by reading type-contract.rkt

8. Fix require/untyped-contract for submod paths
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/907>
  Found by writing a 1-file test

9. Fix pict struct type
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/923>
  Ran Transient on typed-racket-test/succeed/pict.rkt

10. Fix byte-regexp? contract
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/921>
  Ran Transient on a function that expected a byte-regexp; unlike TR, the
  function triggers contract-generation

11. Add case to values type
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/918>
  Wrote test that unexpectedly failed, I think

12. Remove sc cache (orig = fix empty cache typo)
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/913>
  Ran type-contract.rkt code expecting improvement / hits

13. Pict type-env keyword args
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/884>
  Used transient to create a pict for thesis proposal

14. Sequence bad inference
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/855>
  Ran Transient on plot, I think (maybe from immutable-vector effort)

15. Add function type annotations
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/612>
  Ran defender.rkt

16. Fix list-length/sc
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/600/files>
  Read static-contracts/combinators/lengths.rkt (maybe from immutable-vector effort)

17. Add static check for #:struct clauses
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/925>
  Inspired by 9 above, TR#923

18. Reorder pict struct fields
  <https://github.com/racket/pict/pull/60>
  Found by testing 17 above, TR#925

19. Provide struct info through require/typed
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/926>
  Found in gregor by mixing guarded and transient, a match-define failed with
  a syntax error.

20. Allow type-environment to provide the constructor
  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/927>
  Found by writing tests for 17 but ignored, got suspicious reading code while
  working on 19.

21. Fix method optional / keyword expansion
  <https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3182>
  Found when fsmoo benchmarks failed a Transient check; expected `Real` got
   `#<unsafe-undefined>`

22. Bad CS cross-module inlining
  <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3339>
  Found running `acquire`, an adaptor uses a symbol contract and transient
   checks `eq?` with a small lambda.
