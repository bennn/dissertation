Q. why is transient zordoz so much worse than typed?

typed has few interactions,
 according to POPL16,
 the main <===> zo-find boundary has <1000 crossings,
 and the others have <10
so boundaries are not bad

the worst configuration is 01000 roughly, when zo-find is typed,
 and its require/typed do ask for functions and lists,
 but those lists get fully traversed

so I guess transient pays for every access, and the other transient checks
 (where D has nothing) add up past the other boundary costs
