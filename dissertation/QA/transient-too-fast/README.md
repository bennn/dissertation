transient is too fast in some ratios, here is the incredible table in the
 dissertation today


```
  \hbox{Benchmark} & \hbox{deep/untyped} & \hbox{shallow/untyped} \\
  sieve & \hbox{0.97} & \hbox{1.00} \\
  forth & \hbox{0.65} & \hbox{1.59} \\
  fsm & \hbox{0.54} & \hbox{0.06} \\
  fsmoo & \hbox{0.88} & \hbox{0.15} \\

```

Transient should NEVER be faster than fully-typed. Never.

The Deep data is based on BC, the Shallow on CS, so that's a problem, but
 these ratios are crazy.

- fsmoo
  should be ~ deep/untyped = 0.59 shal/untyped = 0.64
  deep is a little slow, shallow TOO FAST
  current shallow-untyped ~ 2000ms (!!!!) shallow-typed ~ 304ms (ok)

- fsm 

OK seems like 2 big problems:

- type (Name: _ _) needs to be resolved and checked,
  but type (F: _) is trivial, either top or bottom depending on where it appears

- defender needs to say "NO SIDE" when generating, skip the SC optimizer
  all together
  side = typed -> optimize all to Top
  side = untyped -> optimize nothing, but reject occurrence types
                    because those can't appear in a require/typed
