@; sound GT has cost
Sound gradual types come with performance overhead.
A soundness theorem guarantees that static types are valid claims about the
 run-time behavior of a program.
Gradual types can mix with untyped code.
Therefore, a gradual typing system needs run-time checks to protect typed
 code from invalid untyped values.
These run-time checks impose a cost in proportion to the frequency
 of typed/untyped interactions, the nature of the data that crosses
 these type boundaries, and the strength of the soundness guarantee.

@; must measure
Language designers must measure the overhead of gradual types
 to judge the overall usefulness of a gradual typing system.
 @; ... benefits vs costs
Users need to know what kind of performance to expect.
Implementors need a baseline to quantify improvements and
 justify alternative gradual typing approaches.

This chapter presents a systematic and scalable evaluation method that I
 developed with several collaborators---notably Asumu Takikawa and Zeina
 Migeed.
The method summarizes performance for the exponentially-many ways that a programmer
 can mix typed and untyped code by focusing on a binary "goodness" measure.
Informally, a mixture is good if it is fast enough to use.
Random sampling can approximate the proportion of good mixtures for programs
 in which exhaustive evaluation is not practical.


@section{Design Criteria}
@; are there good words, from Asumu?, we can use to talk about criteria/requirements?
@; "background" assumptions

@; - benchmarks, "representative"
@; - space = 2^N configurations
@; - goal = % deliverable
@;   -- baseline = no gradual typing

The goal of performance evaluation is to predict the experiences of future
 users.
Such users likely agree with the migration plan listed in @chapter-ref{chap:why}
 and are eager to test new typed/untyped combinations.
Experience with Typed Racket indicates that this is exactly what happens;
 programmers combine typed and untyped code any way that the system allows.
Applications undergo such transitions in a gradual, step-by-step manner.
In a typical evolution, programmers compare the performance of the modified
 program with the previous version.
If type-driven optimizations result in a performance improvement, all is well.
Otherwise, the programmer may need to address the overhead with additional
 modifications.

These observations and assumptions about users suggest three basic criteria
 for an evaluation method.

@parag{Begin with representative benchmarks}
An evaluation method must measure programs, and is in turn limited by the
 chosen benchmarks.
We need a variety of benchmarks from which to draw conclusions.
Where possible, benchmarks should be adapted from real programs.
Otherwise, benchmarks should stress-test specific parts of the language.


@parag{Summarize an exponentially-large space}
@(let ((num-example-configs 5)) (list @elem{

 possible combinations (@figure-ref{fig:example-lattice-0}).
Languages that offer types at a finer granularity have even more possibilities.
In general, an evaluation must treat each combination as equally-likely.

@parag{Focus on overhead}
@(let ((example-overhead 8)) @elem{
Because a gradual program starts from an original program, the first question
 is how adding types changes performance.
Hence we can always assume two versions for any program: the current
 typed/untyped configuration and the same code without any gradual types.
The latter @emph{baseline} program helps anchor an evaluation.
If a programmer can tolerate a certain overhead, say @id[example-overhead]x,
 then a single number can summarize the good parts of the exponentially-large
 configuation space; namely, the percent of configurations that run fast enough.
})



@; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Exhaustive Evaluation Method}

We have developed two methods to measure the performance of a gradually-typed
 program: an exhaustive method that considers the entire configuration space,
 and an approximation thereof.
This section presents the exhaustive method---first by example and then more
 formally.


@subsection{By Example}

A Typed Racket program is a collection of modules (@figure-ref{fig:example-program}).
Some modules are under the direct control of the programmer;
 these migratable modules are often identified with the program.
Other modules are controlled by different programmers.
These contextual modules may come from the standard library or
 a package registry.

@figure*["fig:example-program" @elem{
  Example Typed Racket program.
  The four @emph{migratable} modules on the left are under the programmer's control.
  The two @emph{contextual} modules on the right represent libraries and core
   language APIs.
  }
  (make-example-program-pict)
]

Gradual typing in Typed Racket lets a programmer choose the language
 for each migratable module.
Thus a program with @${N} migratable modules opens a space of @${2^N}
 possibilites (@figure-ref{fig:example-lattice-0})---and no more, because the
 contextual modules are not easily open to modification.

@(let* ((lattice-version "6.4")
        (S (tr:benchmark-name->performance-info 'fsm lattice-version))
        (num-modules (tr:benchmark->num-modules tr:fsm))
       ) @list[
@elem{
An exhaustive performance evaluation must consider all @${2^N} possibilities.
After all, a programmer might choose any one; there is no reason why
 not.
To give one example, the performance lattice in @figure-ref{fig:example-lattice}
 shows this full dataset for a program named @bm{fsm} that has @id[num-modules]
 migratable modules.
The @integer->word[(expt 2 num-modules)] configurations are arranged in a
 lattice with the fully-untyped configuration on the bottom and the fully-typed
 configuration on top.
A given row in the lattice groups configurations with the same number of typed
 modules (black squares).
For instance, configurations in the second row from the bottom contain two
 typed modules.
These represent all possible ways of converting two modules in the untyped
 configuration to Typed Racket.
Similarly, configurations in the third row represent all possible
 configurations a programmer might encounter after applying three such
 @emph{type conversion steps} to the untyped configuration.
In general, let the notation @${c_1 \rightarrow_k c_2} express the idea
 that a programmer starting from configuration @${c_1} (in row
 @${i}) could reach configuration @${c_2} (in row @${j}) after
 taking at most @${k} type conversion steps (@${j - i \le k}).
}
@figure*["fig:example-lattice" @elem{

    (performance-lattice S))
]
@elem{
Configurations in @figure-ref{fig:example-lattice} are furthermore labeled
 with their performance overhead relative to the untyped configuration on Racket
 version @|lattice-version|.
With these labels, a language implementor can draw several conclusions about
 the performance overhead of gradual typing in this program.
A first observation is that the fully-typed code runs the same speed as untyped.
This 1x overhead is also the overall best point in the lattice.
Six other configurations run within a 2x overhead, but the rest suffer
 from orders-of-magnitude slowdowns.
Gradual typing in @bm{fsm} can come at a huge cost.
}
@elem{
Drawing such conclusions is not easy, however, even for this small program.
Analyzing a lattice for programs with eight or more modules is clearly infeasible.
@Figure-ref{fig:overhead-plot-example} presents a graphical alternative,
 an @emph{overhead plot},
 that anonymizes configurations and focuses on overhead relative to untyped.
@; TODO awkward, haven't introduced ddeliv yet!
Overhead plots are cumulative distribution functions.
As the value of @${D} increases along the @|x-axis|, the number of
 @ddeliverable{D} configurations is monotonically increasing.
The important question is how many configurations are @ddeliverable{D}
 for low values of @${D}.
If this number is large, then a developer who applies gradual typing to a
 similar program has a large chance that the configuration they arrive at
 is a @ddeliverable{D} configuration.
The area under the curve is the answer to this question.
A curve with a large shaded area below it implies that a large number
 of configurations have low performance overhead.

@(let ([d0 "d_0"]
       [d1 "d_1"]) @elem{
  The second most important aspects of an overhead plot are the two values of @${D}
   where the curve starts and ends.
  More precisely, if @${h\!:\!\mathbb{R}^+\!\rightarrow\!\mathbb{N}} is a function
   that counts the percent of @ddeliverable{D}
   configurations in a benchmark, the critical points are the smallest
   overheads @${@|d0|, @|d1|} such
   that @${h(@|d0|)\!>\!0\%} and @${h(@|d1|)\!=\!100\%}.
  An ideal start-value would lie between zero and one; if @${@|d0|\!<\!1} then
   at least one configuration runs faster than the Python baseline.
  The end-value @${@|d1|} is the overhead of the slowest-running configuration.
})

Lastly, the slope of a curve corresponds to the likelihood that
 accepting a small increase in performance overhead increases the number
 of deliverable configurations.
A flat curve (zero slope) suggests that the performance of a group of
 configurations is dominated by a common set of type annotations.
Such observations are no help to programmers facing performance issues,
 but may help language designers find inefficiencies in their implementation
 of gradual typing.

@; TODO more words here?

To summarize, the exhaustive method has three steps:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
 @item{
   identify a suite of fully-typed programs;
 }
 @item{
   measure the performance of all gradually-typed @emph{configurations} of the programs;
 }
 @item{

 }
]


@subsection{By Definition}

The following definitions capture the intuitions above and generalize
 beyond Typed Racket.
As a running example, this section will use Reticulated Python to demonstrate
 the generalization.
Reticulated permits optional types for every parameter to a function,
 every function return type, and every class field.

A gradual typing system enriches a dynamically typed language with a notion of static typing;
 that is, some pieces of a program can be statically typed.
The @emph{granularity} of a gradual typing system defines the minimum size of
 such pieces in terms of abstract syntax.
A performance evaluation must define its own granularity to systematically
 explore the ways that a programmer may write type annotations, subject to
 practical constraints.

@definition["granularity"]{
  The @emph{granularity} of an evaluation is the syntactic unit at which
   the evaluation adds or removes type annotations.
}

For example, the evaluation in @citet{tfgnvf-popl-2016} is at the granularity
 of modules.
The evaluation in @citet{vss-popl-2017} is at the granularity
 of whole programs.
@Section-ref{sec:protocol} defines the @emph{function and class-fields} granularity, which we use for this evaluation.

After defining a granularity, a performance evaluation must define a suite of
 programs to measure.
A potential complication is that such programs may depend on external libraries
 or other modules that lie outside the scope of the evaluation.
It is important to distinguish these so-called @emph{contextual modules} from the
 focus of the experiment.

@definition["migratable, contextual"]{
  The @emph{migratable modules} in a program define its configurations.
  The @emph{contextual modules} in a program are common across all configurations.
}

The granularity and migratable modules define the
 @emph{configurations} of a fully-typed program.

@definition["configurations"]{
  Let @${P \tcstep P'}
   if and only if program @${P'} can be obtained from
   @${P} by annotating one syntactic unit in an migratable module.
  Let @${\tcmulti} be the reflexive, transitive closure of the @${\tcstep}
   relation.
  {The @${\tcstep} relation expresses the notion of a
   @emph{type conversion step}@~cite{tfgnvf-popl-2016,gtnffvf-jfp-2019}.
   The @${\tcmulti} relation expresses the notion of @emph{term precision}@~cite{svcb-snapl-2015}.}
  @; note^2: `e0 -->* e1` if and only if `e1 <= e0`
  The @emph{configurations} of a fully-typed program @${P^\tau} are all
   programs @${P} such that @${P\!\tcmulti P^\tau}.
  Furthermore, @${P^\tau} is a so-called @emph{fully-typed configuration};
   an @emph{untyped configuration} @${P^\lambda} has the property @${P^\lambda\!\tcmulti P}
   for all configurations @${P}.
}

An evaluation must measure the performance overhead of these configurations
 relative to some default.
A natural baseline is the performance of the original program, distinct from the
 gradual typing system.

@definition["baseline"]{
 The @emph{baseline performance} of a program is its running time in the absence
  of gradual typing.
}

In Typed Racket, the baseline is the performance of Racket running the
 untyped configuration.
In Reticulated, the baseline is Python running the untyped configuration.
This is not the same as Reticulated running the untyped configuration
 because Reticulated inserts checks in untyped code@~cite{vksb-dls-2014}.

@definition["performance ratio"]{
  A @emph{performance ratio} is the running time of a configuration
   divided by the baseline performance of the untyped configuration.
}

An @emph{exhaustive} performance evaluation measures the performance of every
 configuration.
The natural way to interpret this data is to choose a notion of
 ``good performance'' and count the proportion of ``good'' configurations.
In this spirit, @citet{tfgnvf-popl-2016} ask programmers to consider the
 performance overhead they could deliver to clients.

@definition[@ddeliverable{D}]{
  For @$|{D \in \mathbb{R}^{+}}|, a configuration is @emph{@ddeliverable{D}}
   if its performance ratio is no greater than @${D}.
}


@subsection{Threats and Limitations}

Fixed types.
@; TODO

Granularity doesn't go inside type, to allow List(Dyn) etc.
@; TODO

Plots in the style of @figure-ref{fig:overhead-plot-example} rest on two
 assumptions.
Readers must keep these in mind as they
 interpret the results.

@; - assn: log scale
The first assumption is that configurations with less than 2x overhead
 are significantly more practical than configurations with a 10x overhead or more.
Hence the plots use a log-scaled x-axis to simultaneously encourage
 fine-grained comparison in the 1.2x to 1.6x overhead range and blur the
 distinction between, e.g., 14x and 18x slowdowns.

@; - assn: 20x
The second assumption is that configurations with more than @id[tr:MAX-OVERHEAD]x
 overhead are completely unusable in practice.
Pathologies like the 100x slowdowns in @figure-ref{fig:example-lattice}
 represent a challenge for implementors, but if these overheads suddenly
 dropped to 30x, the configurations would still be useless to developers.


@section{Approximate Evaluation Method}

If an exhaustive performance evaluation is infeasible, an alternative is
 to select configurations via simple random sampling and measure the
 proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in the sample.
Repeating this sampling experiment yields a @emph{simple random approximation}
 of the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.

@definition[@sraapproximation["r" "s" "95"]]{
  Given @${r} samples each containing @${s} configurations chosen uniformly at random,
   a @emph{@sraapproximation["r" "s" "95"]} is a @${95\%} confidence interval for
   the proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in each sample.
}

Intuitively, this sampling method should lead to good results because
 it randomly samples a stable population.
If the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in a program
 happens to be 10%, then one random selection has a 1 in 10 chance of
 drawing a @ddeliverable{D} configuration.

A statistical justification depends on the law of large numbers the
 central limit theorem.
Let @${d} be a predicate that checks whether a configuration
 is @ddeliverable{D}.
Since @${d} is either true or false for every configuration,
 this predicate defines a Bernoulli random variable @${X_d} with parameter
 @${p}, where @${p} is the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.
Consequently, the expected value of this random variable is @${p}.
The law of large numbers states that the average of @emph{infinitely}
 many samples of @${X_d} converges to @${p}, the true proportion
 of deliverable configurations.
We cannot draw infinitely many samples, but perhaps this convergence
 property means that the average of ``enough'' samples is ``close'' to @${p}.
Indeed, the central limit theorem guarantees that any sequence of
 such averages is normally distributed around the true proportion.
A @${95\%} confidence interval generated from sample averages is therefore
 likely to contain the true proportion.

The statistical argument reveals two weaknesses in the sampling method.

@itemlist[
@item{
  First, there is no guarantee that every confidence interval based on sampling
   contains the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.
  The results can mislead.
}
@item{
  Second, the confidence intervals could be huge.
  A wide interval offers little insight, even if it happens to contain the
   true proportion.
  (In the extreme, a useless interval says that 0% to 100% of configurations
   are @ddeliverable{D}.)
}
]

The argument does say, however, that an interval is more likely to be useful
 if based on a huge number of samples, each sample containing a huge number
 of configurations.
Question is, how well does a manageable experiment size work in practice?

@Figure-ref["fig:tr:validate-sample" "fig:rp:validate-sample"] test the
 @sraapproximation["r" "s" "95"] method using 
 @${r\!=\!@id[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS]} samples each containing a linear
 number of configurations.
More precisely, each sample contains @${@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!N} configurations
 out of the @${2^N} possibilities in the benchmark at hand.
These plots show both the true data and the result of sampling:
 a solid blue line shows the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations,
 and an orange interval shows the result of approximation.
Don't worry about the interpretation of the blue lines for now,
 the application sections go into great detail.

@render-overhead-plot*[
  "fig:tr:validate-sample"
  @elem{Typed Racket sample validation.}

  rp:cache-dir
]

In each plot, the sample intervals are both thin and capture the true
 proportion.
Thus a linear number of samples appears sufficient.


@subsection{Statistical Protocol}

For readers interested in reproducing the above results, this section describes
 the protocol that generated @figure-ref["fig:tr:validate-sample" "fig:rp:validate-sample"].

To generate one random sample, select @${@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!N} configurations
 without replacement and compute their overhead.
We have tried sampling with replacement and found similar results.

To generate a confidence interval for the number of @ddeliverable{D}
 configurations based on a group of samples, calculate
 the proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in each sample and generate
 a 95% confidence interval from the proportions.
This is the simple @emph{index method} for computing a
 confidence interval from a sequence of ratios (@format-url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.2024v1.pdf}).
We have not experimented with a more precise method such as
 Fieller's@~cite{f-rss-1957}.


@section{Benchmark Selection}

Our approach to benchmarks.
As large as possible.
As real as possible.
To this end, "origin" below and credits to original programs author.
Some however from benchmark suite chosen because prior Python evaluation.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:tr:conversion"]{From Programs to Benchmarks}

To convert a Reticulated program into a benchmark, we:
 (1) build a driver module that runs the program and collects timing information;
 (2) remove any non-determinism or I/O actions;
 (3) partition the program into migratable and contextual modules; and
 (4) add type annotations to the migratable modules.
That said, @integer->word[(length '(aespython futen http2 slowSHA))]
 benchmarks inadvertantly perform I/O actions, see @section-ref{sec:rp:threats}.
We modify any Python code that Reticulated's type
 system cannot validate, such as code that requires untagged unions or polymorphism.


@string-titlecase[@integer->word[(- (*NUM-BENCHMARKS*) (length TYPED-BM*))]] of
 the benchmark programs are adaptations of untyped programs.
The other three benchmarks (@bm{fsm}, @bm{synth}, and @bm{quad}) use most of
 the type annotations and code from originally-typed programs.
Any differences between the original programs and the benchmarks are due to the
 following five complications.

First, the addition of types to untyped code occasionally requires type casts or small refactorings.
For example, the expression @racket[(string->number "42")] has the Typed Racket type @racket[(U Complex #f)].
This expression cannot appear in a context expecting an @racket[Integer] without an explicit type cast.
As another example, the @bm{quad} programs call a library function to partition a @racket[(Listof (U A B))] into a @racket[(Listof A)] and a @racket[(Listof B)] using a predicate for values of type @racket[A].
Typed Racket cannot currently prove that values which fail the predicate have type @racket[B], so the @bm{quad} benchmarks replace the call with two filtering passes.

Second, Typed Racket cannot enforce certain types across a type boundary.
For example, the core datatypes in the @bm{synth} benchmark are monomorphic
 because Typed Racket cannot dynamically enforce parametric polymorphism on
 instances of an untyped structure.

Third, any contracts present in the untyped programs are represented as type
 annotations and in-line assertions in the derived benchmarks.
The @bm{acquire} program in particular uses contracts to ensure that certain
 lists are sorted and have unique elements.
The benchmark enforces these conditions with explicit pre and post-conditions
 on the relevant functions.

Fourth, each @emph{static import} of an untyped struct type into typed code
 generates a unique datatype.
Typed modules that share instances of an untyped struct must therefore
 reference a common static import site.
The benchmarks include additional contextual modules, called @emph{adaptor
 modules}, to provide this canonical import site; for each module @${M} in the
 original program that exports a struct, the benchmark includes an adaptor
 module that provides type annotations for every identifier exported by @${M}.
Adaptor modules add a layer of indirection, but this indirection does not add
 measurable performance overhead.

Fifth, some benchmarks use a different modularization than the original program.
The @bm{kcfa} benchmark is modularized according to comments in the original,
 single-module program.
The @bm{suffixtree}, @bm{synth}, and @bm{gregor} benchmarks each have a single
 file containing all their data structure definitions; the original programs
 defined these structures in the same module as the functions on the structures.
Lastly, the @bm{quadBG} benchmark has two fewer modules than @bm{quadMB}
 because it inlines the definitions of two (large) data structures that
 @bm{quadMB} keeps in separate files.
Removing these boundaries has a negligible affect on performance overhead and
 greatly reduces the number of configurations.



@; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section[#:tag "sec:tr:evaluation"]{Application 1: Typed Racket}

As a first validation of the method, we measured Typed Racket.
This evaluation proved that the method can give useful summaries and
 helped us refine our visualizations.
It also revealed significant challenges for Typed Racket's @|sguarded|
 approach to gradual typing.
Overheads of several orders of magnitude were common.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:tr:protocol"]{Protocol}

@parag{Granularity}
The granularity of this evaluation is @emph{modules}, same as the granularity
 of Typed Racket.
One syntactic unit in the experiment is one entire module.
Converting one unit requires changing the language to Typed Racket and

 code yet small enough to make exhaustive performance evaluation tractable.
The following descriptions of the benchmark programs---arranged by size as
 measured in number of migratable modules---briefly summarize their relevant
 characteristics.
Each description comes with four fields:
 @emph{Origin} indicates the benchmark's source,
 @emph{Purpose} describes what it computes,
 @emph{Author} credits the original author,
 and @emph{Depends} lists any libraries of contextual modules that the benchmark depends on.
This section concludes with a table summarizing the static characteristics of each benchmark.

  The two versions of this benchmark differ in their type annotations, but have nearly identical source code.

  The original version, @bm{quadMB}, uses type annotations by the original author.
  This version has a high typed/untyped ratio
   because it explicitly compiles types to runtime predicates
   and uses these predicates to eagerly check data invariants.
  In other words, the typed configuration is slower than the untyped configuration because it performs more work.

  The second version, @bm{quadBG}, uses identical code but weakens types to match the untyped configuration.
  This version is therefore suitable for judging the implementation
   of Typed Racket rather than the user experience of Typed Racket.

@Figure-ref{fig:tr:ratio} lists the overhead of static types in the benchmarks.
In @bm{sieve}, for example, the fully-typed configuration runs slightly
 faster than untyped.
In @bm{forth}, the typed configuration is almost 10x slower.

@parag{Performance Ratios, Conclusions}

Overall, the typed configurations run slightly slower than the untyped code.
These small slowdowns are due to type casts on input data and on
 contextual modules.

A few benchmarks, notably @bm{lnm} and @bm{suffixtree}, run faster when
 typed.
For @bm{lnm}, the speedup is due to a typed contextual module than slows
 down the untyped configuration.
For @bm{suffixtree}, we have a positive speedup thanks to the Typed Racket
 optimizer.

Three benchmarks suffer tremendously when typed: @bm{forth}, @bm{zombie},
 and @bm{quadMB}.
Type casts play a large role.
The newest version of the benchmarks should avoid these pathologies.

Many curves are quite flat; they demonstrate that gradual typing introduces
 large and widespread performance overhead in the corresponding benchmarks.
Among benchmarks with fewer than @|suffixtree-num-modules| modules, the
 most common shape is a flat line near the 50% mark.
Such lines imply that the performance of a group of configurations is
 dominated by a single type boundary.
@; For instance, there is one type boundary in @bm{fsm} that adds overwhelming slowdown when present; all eight configurations with this boundary have over @|max-str| overhead.
Benchmarks with @|suffixtree-num-modules| or more modules generally have
 smoother slopes, but five such benchmarks have essentially flat curves.
The overall message is that for many values of @${D} between 1 and
 @|max-str|, few configurations are @ddeliverable{}.

For example, in @integer->word[(- num-bm num-mostly-2-deliverable)] of the
 @|num-bm-str| benchmark programs, at most half the configurations are
 @ddeliverable{2} on any version.
The situation is worse for lower (more realistic) overheads, and does not
 improve much for higher overheads.
Similarly, there are ten benchmarks in which at most half the
 configurations are @ddeliverable{10}.

The curves' endpoints describe the extremes of gradual typing.
The left endpoint gives the percentage of configurations that run at least
 as quickly as the untyped configuration.
Except for the @bm{lnm} benchmark, such configurations are a low proportion of the total.
The right endpoint shows how many configurations suffer over 20x performance overhead.
@string-titlecase[num-max-deliverable-str] benchmarks have at least one such configuration.

In summary, the application of the evaluation method projects a negative
 image of Typed Racket's sound gradual typing.
Only a small number of configurations in the benchmark suite run with low
 overhead; a mere @|lo-prop| of all configurations are @ddeliverable[lo] on
 Racket v@|v-max|.
Many demonstrate extreme overhead; @|hi-prop| of all configurations are not
 even @ddeliverable[hi] on version @|v-max|.

@section[#:tag "sec:rp:evaluation"]{Application 2: Reticulated Python}

Together with Zeina Migeed, I conducted a performance evaluation for Reticulated
 Python.
This evaluation led to three broad benefits.

In terms of the method, this evaluation required generalizing and scaling.
It was an opportunity to validate random sampling, and in turn random sampling
 was an essential part of our success.

For gradual typing, the evaluation served as the first comprehensive test
 of the @|stransient| approach.
Whereas Typed Racket's @|snatural| approach suffers from slowdowns of over
 two orders of magnitude, @|stransient| never exceeded 10x overhead.
The catch, however, is that the fully-typed configuration is slowest in
 @|stransient| but fastest in @|sguarded|.
Instead of proving @|stransient| the clear winner, the evaluation revealed
 a tradeoff.

Third, the evaluation revealed issues with the implementation of @|stransient|
 in Reticulated Python where benchmarks had anomolous results.
We found two soundness holes: one with optional function parameters and one
 with tuples.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:rp:protocol"]{Protocol}

@parag{Granularity}
The granularity of this evaluation is @emph{function and class fields}.
One syntactic unit in the experiment is either one function,
 one method, or the collection of all fields for one class.
@; TODO example
@; TODO connect to static figure ... use N everywhere? ... say "units"?


@parag{Data Collection}
For benchmarks with at most @$|{2^{17}}| configurations, we conduct an exhaustive
 evaluation.
For larger benchmarks we conduct a simple random approximation using
 @integer->word[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS] samples each containing @${@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!(F + C)}
 configurations, where @${F} is the number of functions in the benchmark and
 @${C} is the number of classes.
Note that the number @id[SAMPLE-RATE] was chosen simply to collect
 as much data as possible in a reasonable amount of time.

All data in this paper was produced by jobs we sent
 to the @hyperlink["https://kb.iu.edu/d/bezu"]{@emph{Karst at Indiana University}}
 computing cluster.
Each job:

   average time of running the same code using Python.
  Similarly, the @|rp:t/u-ratio| for @bm{futen} states that the fully-typed configuration

}

@parag{Performance Ratios, Conclusions}
@elem{
  Migrating a benchmark to
   Reticulated, or from untyped to fully-typed, always adds performance overhead.
  The migration never improves performance.
  The overhead is always within an order-of-magnitude.

  Regarding the @|rp:u/p-ratio|s:
   @integer->word[rp-<2] are below @${2}x,
   @integer->word[(- rp-<3 rp-<2)] are between @${2}x and @${3}x, and
   the remaining @integer->word[(- rp-<4.5 rp-<3)] are below @${4.5}x.
  The @|rp:t/u-ratio|s are typically lower:
   @integer->word[tr-<2] are below @${2}x,
   @integer->word[(- tr-<3 tr-<2)] are between @${2}x and @${3}x,
   and the final @integer->word[(- tr-<3.5 tr-<3)] are below @${3.5}x.

  @Integer->word[num->] benchmarks have larger @|rp:u/p-ratio|s than @|rp:t/u-ratio|s.
  Given that an untyped Reticulated program offers the same safety guarantees
   as Python, it is surprising that the @|rp:u/p-ratio|s are so large.

]

@Figures-ref["fig:rp:overhead" (exact-ceiling (/ (length rp:MAIN-BENCHMARKS) overhead-plots-per-page))] summarizes the overhead of gradual typing in the
 benchmark programs.
Each plot reports the percent of @ddeliverable[] configurations (@|y-axis|)
 for values of @${D} between @${1}x overhead and @${@id[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD]}x overhead (@|x-axis|).
The @|x-axes| are log-scaled to focus on low overheads;
 vertical tick marks appear at @${1.2}x, @${1.4}x, @${1.6}x, @${1.8}x, @${4}x, @${6}x, and @${8}x overhead.

The heading above the plot for a given benchmark states the benchmark's name
 and indicate whether the data is exhaustive or approximate.
If the data is exhaustive, this heading lists the number of configurations
 in the benchmark.
If the data is approximate, the heading lists the number of samples
 and the number of randomly-selected configurations in each sample.

The curves for the approximate data
 (i.e., the curves for @bm{sample_fsm}, @bm{aespython}, and @bm{stats}) are intervals
 rather than fixed-width lines.
For instance, the height of an interval at @${x\!=\!4} is the range of the
 @sraapproximation[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS (format "[~a(F+C)]" SAMPLE-RATE) "95"]
 for the number of @ddeliverable[4] configurations.
These intervals are thin because there is little variance in the proportion
 of @ddeliverable{D} configurations across the @integer->word[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS]
 samples; that said, the @bm{sample_fsm} curve is visibly thicker than the
 @bm{aespython} curve.


@parag{Overhead Plot, Conclusions}
Curves in @figures-ref["fig:rp:overhead" (exact-ceiling (/ (length rp:MAIN-BENCHMARKS) overhead-plots-per-page))] typically cover a large area and reach the
 top of the @|y-axis| at a low value of @${D}.
This value is always less than @${@id[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD]}.
In other words, every configuration in the
 experiment is @ddeliverable[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD].
For many benchmarks, the maximum overhead is significantly lower.

  Indeed, @integer->word[num-2-deliv] benchmarks are nearly @ddeliverable[2].})

None of the configurations in the experiment run faster than the Python baseline.
This is to be expected, given the @|rp:u/p-ratio|s in @figure-ref{fig:rp:ratio} and the
 fact that Reticulated translates type annotations into run-time checks.

    The plots for the other @integer->word[(- rp:NUM-EXHAUSTIVE-BENCHMARKS (length smooth))]
     benchmarks have wide, flat segments.
    These flat segments are due to functions that are frequently executed
     in the benchmarks' traces; all configurations in which one of these functions
     is typed incur a significant performance overhead.

The notable exception is @bm{spectralnorm}, in which the fully-typed configuration
 runs faster than @${@id[S-SLOWER]\%} of all configurations.
Unfortunately, this speedup is due to a soundness bug
 (@github-issue["mvitousek" "reticulated" 36]);
 in short, the implementation of Reticulated does not type-check the contents of tuples.

})

Second, the experiment considers one fully-typed configuration per benchmark;
 however, there are many ways of typing a given program.
The types in this experiment may differ from types ascribed by another Python
 programmer, which, in turn, may lead to different performance overhead.

  Third, some benchmarks use dynamic typing.
  The @bm{take5} benchmark contains one function that accepts optional arguments,
   and is therefore dynamically typed (@github-issue["mvitousek" "reticulated" 32]).
  The @bm{go} benchmark uses dynamic typing because Reticulated cannot validate
   its use of a recursive class definition.
  Two other benchmarks use dynamic typing to overcome Reticulated's lack of
   untagged union types; namely, @format-bm*[retic-limited]

@(let ([use-io* '(aespython futen http2 slowSHA)]) @elem{
  Fourth, the @(authors* (map bm use-io*)) benchmarks read from a file
   within their timed computation.
  We nevertheless consider our results representative.
})

Fifth, Reticulated supports a finer granularity of type annotations than the
 experiment considers.
Function signatures can leave some arguments untyped, and class field
 declaractions can omit types for some members.
We believe that a fine-grained evaluation would support the
 conclusions presented in this paper.

@;@subsection[#:tag "sec:tr:compare"]{Evaluating Relative Performance}
@;
@;Although the absolute performance of Racket version 6.4 is underwhelming, it is a significant improvement over versions 6.2 and 6.3.
@;This improvement is manifest in the difference between curves on the overhead plots.
@;For example in @bm{gregor} (third plot in @figure-ref{fig:lnm:3}), version 6.4 has at least as many deliverable configurations as version 6.2 for any overhead on the @${x}-axis.
@;The difference is greatest near @${x=2}; in terms of configurations, over 80% of @bm{gregor} configurations are not @ddeliverable{2} on v6.2 but are @ddeliverable{2} on v6.4.
@;The overhead plots for many other benchmarks demonstrate a positive difference between the number of @ddeliverable{D} configurations on version 6.4 relative to version 6.2.
@;
@;The plot of @figure-ref{fig:scale:delta} explicitly shows the improvement of version 6.4 over version 6.2.
@;It consists of @integer->word[(*NUM-BENCHMARKS*)] purple lines, one for each benchmark.
@;These lines plot the difference between the curves for v6.4 and v6.2 on the corresponding overhead plot.
@;For example, the line for @bm{gregor} (labeled @${\mathsf{r}}) demonstrates a large improvement in the number of @ddeliverable{2} configurations.
@;The plot also shows that fifteen of the @integer->word[(*NUM-BENCHMARKS*)] benchmarks significantly benefit from running on version 6.4.
@;Only the line for the @bm{forth} benchmark demonstrates a significant regression;
@; the @bm{zombie} benchmark demonstrates a small regression due to an increase in the cost of type casts.
@;
@;The improved performance of Racket version 6.4 is due to revisions of the contract system and Typed Racket's use of contracts to enforce static types.
@;In particular, the contract system allocates fewer closures to track the labels that Typed Racket uses to report type boundary errors.
@;The regression in the @bm{forth} benchmark is due to a bug in the implementation of class contracts in version 6.2.
@;This bug would suppress the allocation of certain necessary class contracts.
@;With the bug fixed, @bm{forth} generates the contracts but suffers additional performance overhead.

@;    @rp:render-exact-runtime-plot*[rp:MAIN-BENCHMARKS]

@;  
@;  Since changing the type annotations in a Reticulated program changes its
@;   performance, the language should provide a cost model to help developers
@;   predict the performance of a given configuration.
@;  The plots in @figure-ref{fig:rp:exact} demonstrate that a simple heuristic
@;   works well for these benchmarks: the performance of a configuration is
@;   proportional to the number of type annotations in the configuration.
@;  
@;  @parag{How to Read the Plots}
@;  @Figure-ref{fig:rp:exact} contains one point for every run of every
@;   configuration in the experiment.
@;  (Recall from @section-ref{sec:rp:protocol},
@;   the data for each configuration is @id[rp:NUM-ITERATIONS] runs.)
@;  Each point compares the number of type annotations in a
@;   configuration (@|x-axis|) against its running time, measured in seconds (@|y-axis|).
@;  
@;  The plots contain many points with both the same number of typed components
@;   and similar performance.
@;  To reduce the visual overlap between such points, the points for a given
@;   configuration are spread across the @|x-axis|; in particular,
@;   the @id[rp:NUM-ITERATIONS] points for a configuration with @${N}
@;   typed components lie within the interval @${N\!\pm\!@id[rp:EXACT-RUNTIME-XSPACE]}
@;   on the @|x-axis|.
@;  
@;  For example, @bm{fannkuch} has two configurations: the untyped configuration
@;   and the fully-typed configuration.
@;  To determine whether a point @${(x,y)} in the plot for @bm{fannkuch} represents
@;   the untyped or fully-typed configuration, round @${x} to the nearest integer.
@;  
@;  
@;  @parag{Exact Runtime Conclusions}
@;  
@;  Suppose a programmer starts at an arbitrary configuration and adds some

@;       run faster than similar configurations with fewer typed components.
@;      These speedups are the result of two implementation bugs:
@;       (1) Reticulated does not dynamically check the contents of statically-typed tuples,
@;       and (2) for method calls to dynamically-typed objects, Reticulated performs
@;       a run-time check that overlaps with Python's dynamic typing@~cite{vksb-dls-2014}.

@;  Overall, there is a clear trend that adding type annotations adds performance
@;   overhead.
@;  The increase is typically linear.
@;  On one hand, this observation may help programmers predict performance issues.
@;  On the other hand, the linear increase demonstrates that Reticulated does
@;   not use type information to optimize programs.
@;  In principle a JIT compiler could generate check-free code if it could infer
@;   the run-time type of a variable, but it remains to be seen whether this
@;   approach would improve performance in practice.
