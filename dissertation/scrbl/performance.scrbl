@; sound GT has cost
@|noindent|Sound types come with performance overhead in a mixed-typed language
 because soundness is a claim about behavior and the only way to control
 the behavior of untyped code is via run-time checks.
These checks impose a cost in proportion to
 the frequency of mixed-typed interactions,
 the complexity of the type specifications that govern boundaries,
 and the strength of the soundness guarantee.

Language designers must measure the performance of a mixed-typed language
 to judge its overall usefulness in light of its guarantees.
Type-sound code that runs too slowly is worthless.
At a finer grain, users need an idea of what overhead to expect when they begin
 experimenting with types.
Implementors need a comprehensive performance summary to
 measure improvements to a language and to compare alternative mixed-typed
 designs.
Despite these realities, early reports on mixed-typed languages
 typically lack performance evaluation.
A few acknowledge performance issues in passing@~cite{tf-popl-2008,acftd-scp-2013,vksb-dls-2014}.
Others show only the performance of fully-typed code relative to fully-untyped
 code, skipping the novel configurations in between@~cite{rsfbv-popl-2015,vss-popl-2017}.
But in their defense, the development of a performance method is a challenge
 in itself.

This chapter presents systematic and scalable methods to assess the performance
 of a mixed-typed language.
The methods summarize performance for the exponentially-many ways that a programmer
 can mix typed and untyped code by focusing on a binary quality measure.
Informally, a mixture is good if runs within a user-supplied overhead limit.
Random sampling can approximate the proportion of good mixtures for programs
 in which exhaustive evaluation is not practical.
As validation, this chapter evaluates the performance of two
 mixed-typed languages: Typed Racket and Reticulated Python.


@section{Design Criteria}

The goal of performance evaluation is to predict the experiences of future
 users.
Intuition suggests that the users of a mixed-typed language will begin
 with an untyped codebase and add types step-by-step.
Experience with Typed Racket supports the intuition.
Programmers add types in an incremental fashion and experiment with all sorts of combinations.
When typed libraries enter the picture, untyped programmers unknowingly
 create mixed-typed applications.
In a typical evolution, programmers compare the performance of the modified
 program with the previous version.
If the current performance is on par with the previous, then all is well.
Otherwise, the easy solutions are: adding more types, and rewinding to a
 less-typed version.
These observations and assumptions about users suggest three basic criteria
 for an evaluation method.

@subsection{Representative Benchmarks}

An evaluation method has to measure programs, and the results of
 a particular evaluation are limited by the chosen benchmarks.
Benchmark programs that stem from realistic code and exercise a variety
 of features are an important step toward generalizable results.

@; TODO say more, please


@subsection{Exponential Compression}

@(let ((num-example-configs 5)) (list @elem{
A mixed-typed language promises to support exponentially-many combinations of
 typed and untyped code.
In Typed Racket, for example, a programmer can add types to any module of a program.
Thus a program with @id[num-example-configs] modules leads to
 @${2^@id[num-example-configs]} possible combinations (@figure-ref{fig:example-lattice-0}).
Languages that can mix at a finer granularity support @${2^k} configurations,
 where @${k} is the number of potentially-typed blocks.

Without evidence against certain mixtures, an evaluation
 must collect data for every mixed-typed configuration.
These huge datasets call for a way to compress exponentially-many
 observations into a compact summary.
}

@figure["fig:example-lattice-0" @elem{

@subsection{Report Overheads}

@(let ((example-overhead 13)) @elem{
Because migratory typing starts from an untyped language, programmers
 can always revert to an untyped version of their codebase if types
 prove too expensive.
The existence of this fully-untyped baseline helps anchor an evaluation.
If a programmer can tolerate a certain overhead, say @id[example-overhead]x,
 then a single number can summarize the good parts of the exponentially-large
 configuation space; namely, the percent of configurations that run fast enough.
A second benefit is that overheads make it easy to find points where types
 improve upon the baseline; look for overheads under 1x.
})


@; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Exhaustive Evaluation Method}

An exhaustive evaluation considers all ways that a programmer might
 toggle type annotations.
The method begins with a fully-typed codebase,
 measures all possible mixed-typed configurations,
 and introduces a compact visualization to summarize the results.


@subsection{By Example}

@;@figure*["fig:example-program" @elem{
@;  Example Typed Racket program.

        (num-modules (tr:benchmark->num-modules tr:fsm))
       ) @list[
@para{
A Racket program is a collection of modules.
Technically, there are two kinds of modules in such a collection:
 the @emph{migratable} modules that the program's author has direct
 control over, and the @emph{contextual} modules that come from an
 external library.
A programmer can add types to any migratable module.
Thus a program with @${N} migratable modules opens a space of @${2^N}
 mixed-typed configurations, and each configuration depends on
 the same contextual modules.

For example, @bm{fsm} is a small Racket program that simulates an economy (@section-ref{sec:tr:benchmarks}).
The main functionality is split across @integer->word[num-modules] modules;
 with migratory typing, this leads to @integer->word[(expt 2 num-modules)]
 mixed-typed configurations.
@Figure-ref{fig:example-lattice} shows all these configurations in a lattice,
 with the untyped configuration on the bottom and the fully-typed configuration
 on top.
Nodes in the middle mix typed and untyped code; each row groups all
 configurations with the same number of typed modules.
Lines between nodes represent the addition (or removal) of types from one
 module.

The label below a configuration node reports its overhead relative to
 the untyped configuration on Racket version @|lattice-version|.
With these labels, a language implementor can draw several conclusions about
 performance overhead in @bm{fsm}.
A first observation is that the fully-typed code runs equally fast as
 the untyped baseline.
This 1x overhead is also the overall best point in the lattice.
Six other configurations run within a 2x overhead, but the rest suffer
 from orders-of-magnitude slowdowns.
Types in @bm{fsm} can come at a huge cost.
}

@figure*["fig:example-lattice" @elem{
Performance overhead in @bm{fsm}, on Racket v@|lattice-version|.}

                 [*LATTICE-CONFIG-LABEL-MARGIN* 1])
    (performance-lattice S))
]

@para{

Drawing such conclusions is not easy, however, even for this small program.
Manually analyzing a lattice for programs with eight or more modules is clearly infeasible.
@Figure-ref{fig:overhead-plot-example} presents a graphical alternative,
 an @emph{overhead plot}, that reports configurations' overhead relative
 to the untyped baseline.
Overhead plots are cumulative distribution functions.
As the function proceeds left-to-right for numbers @${D} along the @|x-axis|,
 the curve shows the proportion of all configurations that run at most
 @${D} times slower than the untyped configuration.
For short, these are @ddeliverable{D} configurations.
On the left, there is always at least one @ddeliverable{1} configuration;
 namely, the fully-untyped configuration itself.
The question is whether other configurations run fast as well.
To read such a plot quickly, focus on the area under the curve.
A large shaded area implies that a large number of configurations
 have low overhead.

@(let ([d0 "d_0"]
       [d1 "d_1"]) @elem{
  The second most important aspects of an overhead plot are the two values of @${D}
   where the curve starts and ends.
  More precisely, if @${h\!:\!\mathbb{R}^+\!\rightarrow\!\mathbb{N}} is the CDF
   that counts the proportion of @ddeliverable{D}
   configurations in a benchmark, the critical points are the smallest
   overheads @${@|d0|, @|d1|} such
   that @${h(@|d0|)\!>\!0\%} and @${h(@|d1|)\!=\!100\%}.
  An ideal start-value would lie between zero and one; if @${@|d0|\!<\!1} then
   at least one configuration runs faster than the baseline.
  The end-value @${@|d1|} is the overhead of the slowest-running configuration.
})

Lastly, the slope of a curve corresponds to the likelihood that
 accepting a small increase in performance overhead increases the number
 of deliverable configurations.
A flat curve (zero slope) suggests that the performance of a group of
 configurations is dominated by a common set of type annotations.
Such observations are no help to programmers facing performance issues,
 but may help language implementors fix inefficiencies.

Overhead plots scale to arbitrarily large datasets by compressing
 exponentially-many points into a proportion.
Furthermore, plotting two curves on one axis compares relative performance.
@Figure-ref{fig:relative-overhead-plot-example} demonstrates two curves
 for @bm{fsm}: on Racket v@|lattice-version| and v@|relative-version|.
The latter curve shows a huge improvement thanks to collapsible contracts@~cite{fgsfs-oopsla-2018}.
Indeed, every @bm{fsm} configuration is @ddeliverable{4} on Racket v@|relative-version|.

@subsection[#:tag "chap:performance:definition"]{By Definition}

The exhaustive evaluation method applies to other mixed-typed languages
 as well as Typed Racket.
To encourage adaptations, the following definitions highlight key concepts.
The prose uses Reticulated Python as a running example.

In Reticulated, every parameter to a function, every function return position,
 and every class field can be typed or untyped.
This is a much finer @emph{granularity} than Typed Racket's, in which entire
 modules must be typed as a unit.
The added flexibility means that an experimenter must choose whether to explore:
 coarse, module-grained mixes;
 fine, function-parameter mixes;
 or something in between.

@definition["granularity"]{
  The @emph{granularity} of an experiment is the syntactic unit at which
   it adds/removes type annotations.
}

For example, @citet{tfgnvf-popl-2016} evaluate Typed Racket at the granularity
 of modules.
@citet{vss-popl-2017} evaluate Reticulated at the granularity of whole programs,
 and @citet{gm-pepm-2018} evaluate Reticulated at the granularity of whole
 functions and whole class field sets (@section-ref{sec:rp:protocol}).

After choosing a granularity, an experimenter must pick a suite of
 programs to measure.
A potential complication is that programs may depend on external libraries
 or other modules that lie outside the realistic scope of the evaluation.

@definition["migratable, contextual"]{
  The @emph{migratable} code in a program defines its configurations.
  The @emph{contextual} code in a program is common across all configurations.
}

The granularity and the migratable code define the
 @emph{configurations} of a fully-typed program.

@definition["configurations"]{
  Let @${C \tcstep C'}
   if and only if program @${C'} can be obtained from program
   @${C} by annotating one migratable syntactic unit.
  Let @${\tcmulti} be the reflexive, transitive closure of the @${\tcstep}
   relation.
  The @emph{configurations} of a fully-typed program @${C_\tau} are all
   programs @${C} such that @${C\!\tcmulti C_\tau}.
  Furthermore, @${C_\tau} is a @emph{fully-typed configuration}.
  An @emph{untyped configuration} @${C_\lambda} has the property @${C_\lambda\!\tcmulti C}
   for all configurations @${C}.
}

@|noindent|In terms of prior work, the @${\tcstep} relation includes all
 possible @emph{type conversion steps}@~cite{tfgnvf-popl-2016,gtnffvf-jfp-2019}.
The @${\tcmulti} relation corresponds to @emph{term precision}@~cite{svcb-snapl-2015} as follows:
 @${e_0 \tcmulti\, e_1 \mbox{ only if } e_1 \sqle e_0}.

An evaluation must measure overhead relative to a useful baseline.
For migratory typing, the correct baseline is the original host-language program.

@definition["baseline"]{
 The @emph{baseline performance} of a program is its running time in the absence
  of migratory typing.
}

In Typed Racket, the baseline is the performance of Racket running the
 untyped configuration.
In Reticulated, the baseline is Python running the untyped configuration.
Be advised, Python-running-untyped differs from Reticulated-running-untyped
 because Reticulated inserts checks in every migratable module that
 it sees@~cite{vksb-dls-2014}.

@definition["performance ratio"]{
  A @emph{performance ratio} is the running time of a configuration
   divided by the baseline performance.
}

An exhaustive performance evaluation measures the performance of every
 configuration.
To summarize the data, choose a notion of 
 ``good performance'' and count the proportion of ``good'' configurations.
In this spirit, @citet{tfgnvf-popl-2016} ask programmers to consider the
 performance overhead they could deliver to clients.

@definition[@ddeliverable{D}]{
  A configuration is @emph{@ddeliverable{D}},
   for some @$|{D \in \mathbb{R}^{+}}|,
   if its performance ratio is no greater than @${D}.
}


@subsection[#:tag "sec:perf:limits"]{Known Limitations}

@; TODO overhead plot anonymize

Evaluation begins with a fixed set of types, but there are usually many
 ways to type a piece of code.
Consider the application of an identity function to a number:

@exact{\medskip}
@untyped-codeblock['(
  "((λ(x) x) 61)"
)]

@|noindent|In Typed Racket, the parameter @tt{x} can be given infinitely many
 correct types.
The obvious choices are @tt{Integer} and @tt{Number},
 but other base types work, including @tt{Real} and @tt{Natural}.
Untagged unions bring many options: @tt{(U Real String)}, @tt{(U Real String (-> Boolean))},
 and so on.
Different choices entail different run-time checks, but the method lacks
 a systematic way to explore equally-valid typings.

Along the same lines, the definition of granularity does not talk about
 imprecise types.
In Reticulated, the type @tt{Function([Str], Int)} has three
 less-precise variants that incorporate the dynamic type.
The method only looks at one fully-typed variant, but the others may
 have notable performance implications.

@; TODO 3rd issue = anonymous configs
Overhead plots (@figure-ref{fig:overhead-plot-example}) rest on two assumptions.
@; - assn: log scale
First is that configurations with less than 2x overhead
 are significantly more practical than configurations with a 10x overhead or more.
Hence the plots use a log-scaled x-axis to encourage
 fine-grained comparison in the 1.2x to 1.6x overhead range and to blur the
 distinction among larger numbers.
@; - assn: 20x
Second is that configurations with more than @id[tr:MAX-OVERHEAD]x
 overhead are completely unusable in practice.
Pathologies like the 1000x slowdowns in @figure-ref{fig:example-lattice}
 represent a challenge for implementors, but if these overheads suddenly
 dropped to 30x, the configurations would still be useless to developers.

The main limitation of exhaustive evaluation, however, is its exhaustiveness.
With 20 migratable units, an experiment requires over 1 million measurements.
At a module-level granularity, this limit is somewhat reasonable because each
 module can be arbitrarily large.
But at function-level granularity and finer, the practical limit quickly rules
 out interesting programs.


@section{Approximate Evaluation Method}

The proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in a program can be
 approximated using random sampling.
First, choose several configurations and measure the proportion of
 @ddeliverable{D} configurations in the sample.
Next, repeat the experiment several times.
Combining the proportions in a confidence interval provides an estimate
 for the true proportion.

@definition[@sraapproximation["r" "s" "95"]]{
  Given @${r} samples each containing @${s} configurations chosen uniformly at random,
   a simple random approximation is a @${95\%} confidence interval for
   the proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in each sample.
}

Intuitively, this method should lead to good results because
 it randomly samples a stable population.
If the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in a program
 happens to be 10%, then a random configuration has a 1 in 10
 chance of being @ddeliverable{D}.

A statistical justification depends on the law of large numbers
 and the central limit theorem.
Let @${d} be a predicate that checks whether a configuration
 is @ddeliverable{D}.
Since @${d} is either true or false for every configuration,
 this predicate defines a Bernoulli random variable @${X_d} with parameter
 @${p}, where @${p} is the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.
Consequently, the expected value of this random variable is @${p}.
The law of large numbers states that the average of @emph{infinitely}
 many samples of @${X_d} converges to @${p}, the true proportion
 of deliverable configurations.
We cannot draw infinitely many samples, but perhaps this convergence
 property means that the average of ``enough'' samples is ``close'' to @${p}.
The central limit theorem implies that any sequence of
 such averages is normally distributed around the true proportion.
A @${95\%} confidence interval generated from sample averages is therefore
 likely to contain the true proportion.

The statistical argument reveals two weaknesses:

@itemlist[
@item{
  First, there is no guarantee that every confidence interval based on sampling
   contains the true proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.
  The results can mislead.
}
@item{
  Second, the confidence intervals could be huge.
  A wide interval offers little insight, even if it happens to contain the
   true proportion.
  In the extreme, a totally useless interval says that 0% to 100% of configurations
   are @ddeliverable{D}.
}
]

@|noindent|The argument does say, however, that an interval is very likely to
 be useful if it is based on a huge number of samples each with a huge number
 of configurations.
The challenge is to find parameters that engineer a compromise between
 size and precision.

@render-overhead-plot*[

By comparing sample data to the ground-truth from an exhaustive evaluation,
 I have found that linear sampling gives small and accurate intervals.
@Figure-ref["fig:tr:validate-sample" "fig:rp:validate-sample"] demonstrate
 on a few Typed Racket and Reticulated programs.
The blue curve and shaded area on each plot is the exhaustive data.
The orange interval is a 95% confidence interval based on
 @${r\!=\!@id[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS]} each containing
 @${s\!=\!@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!N} configurations,
 where @${N} is the number of typed units in the benchmark program.
The sample intervals all tightly cover the true proportion
 of @ddeliverable{D} configurations.


@subsection{Statistical Protocol}

For readers interested in reproducing the above results, here are
 additional details about 
 the protocol behind @figure-ref["fig:tr:validate-sample" "fig:rp:validate-sample"].

To generate one random sample, select @${@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!N} configurations
 uniformly at random and compute their overhead.
Sampling with replacement gives the same theoretical results as sampling
 without replacement.
The figures employ sampling without replacement in the hope of finding
 new configurations with exceptional overhead.

To generate a confidence interval for the number of @ddeliverable{D}
 configurations based on a group of samples, calculate
 the proportion of @ddeliverable{D} configurations in each sample and generate
 a 95% confidence interval from the proportions.
This is the simple index method for computing a
 confidence interval from a sequence of ratios (@format-url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.2024v1.pdf}).
A more advanced method may give tighter intervals, if extra precision is needed@~cite{f-rss-1957}.


@section{Benchmark Selection}

Representative benchmarks are difficult to come by.
My best-effort approach is to seek out programs that serve a realistic
 purpose.
Several implement games, and re-play a game round.
Others adapt library code with an example use.
All of the forthcoming Typed Racket benchmarks follow this approach (@section-ref{sec:tr:benchmarks}).
Many of the Reticulated benchmarks, however, come from prior work and
 adapt small benchmark scripts instead (@section-ref{sec:rp:benchmarks}).


@subsection[#:tag "sec:conversion"]{From Programs to Benchmarks}

To convert a program into a benchmark, we:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{
  partition the program into migratable and contextual code;
}
@item{
  build a migratable driver module that runs the program and collects timing information;
}
@item{
  remove any non-determinism or I/O actions;
}
@item{
  find types for the migratable code.
}]

The final step, finding types for untyped code, can be difficult.
First, the type checker may require casts or refactorings to deal with
 untyped code.
For example, untyped Racket code may assume that the
 application @tt{(string->number "42")} returns an integer.
The assumption is correct, but the type checker cannot follow the reasoning
 and needs a run-time check.
Reticulated does not have union types, and therefore falls back to @tt{Dyn}
 for many common untyped patterns.
An experimenter must choose whether to rewrite the pattern or accept the
 trivial typing.

Second, some @|sdeep| type boundaries may lack run-time support.
Typed Racket cannot enforce the type @tt{(U (-> Real) (-> Integer))}
 at a boundary because its contracts lack unions for higher-order wrappers.
The work-around is to rewrite the boundaries or, if possible, simplify
 the types.
For the above, @tt{(-> Real)} is a viable choice.

Third, each static import of a struct type into Typed Racket code
 generates a unique datatype.
Typed modules that share instances of an untyped struct must therefore
 reference a common definition.
Typed Racket benchmarks with this issue include additional contextual
 modules, called @emph{adaptor modules}, to provide a canonical import.

These programs have few boundaries to untyped contextual modules

Many curves are quite flat; they demonstrate that migratory typing introduces
 large and widespread performance overhead in the corresponding benchmarks.
Among benchmarks with fewer than @|suffixtree-num-modules| modules, the
 most common shape is a flat line near the 50% mark.
Such lines imply that the performance of a group of configurations is
 dominated by a single type boundary.
For instance, there is one type boundary in @bm{fsmoo} that adds overwhelming
 slowdown when present; all eight configurations with this boundary have over
 @|max-str| overhead.
Benchmarks with @|suffixtree-num-modules| or more modules generally have
 smoother slopes, but five such benchmarks have essentially flat curves.
The overall message is that for many values of @${D} between 1 and
 @|max-str|, few configurations are @ddeliverable{}.

In @id[num-fail-2d] benchmarks, no more than half the configurations
 are @ddeliverable{2}.
This is quite bad.
The situation is worse for lower (more realistic) overheads, and rarely
 improve at slightly higher overheads.
Even at a generous 10x factor, no more than half the configurations in
 @integer->word[num-fail-10d] benchmarks are good enough.

The curves' endpoints describe the extremes of migratory typing.
The left endpoint gives the percentage of configurations that run at least
 as quickly as the untyped configuration.
With few exceptions, notably @bm{lnm}, these configurations are a low proportion of the total.
The right endpoint shows how many configurations suffer at least 20x overhead.
@string-titlecase[num-max-deliverable-str] benchmarks have at least one such configuration.

In summary, the application of the evaluation method projects a negative
 image of Typed Racket's sound migratory typing.
Only a small number of configurations in the benchmark suite run with low
 overhead; a mere @|lo-prop| of all configurations are @ddeliverable[lo] on
 Racket v@|v-max|.
Many demonstrate extreme overhead; only @|hi-prop| of all configurations are
 @ddeliverable[hi] on v@|v-max|.
})


@subsection[#:tag "sec:tr:threats"]{Threats to Validity}

The concerns raised in @section-ref{sec:conversion} affect this evaluation.
In particular, each benchmark explores one choice of types.
Different types may lead to different conclusions, as @bm{quadT} and
 @bm{quadU} demonstrate at a small scale.

Some benchmarks use a different modularization than the original program.
The @bm{kcfa} benchmark is modularized according to comments in the original,
 single-module program.
The @bm{suffixtree}, @bm{synth}, and @bm{gregor} benchmarks each have a single
 file containing all their data structure definitions, but the original programs
 defined these structures in the same module as the functions on the structures.

@section[#:tag "sec:rp:evaluation"]{Application 2: Reticulated Python}

Reticulated Python is the original home of the @|stransient| semantics for
 mixed-typed programs@~cite{v-thesis-2019}.
@|sTransient| is a type-sound semantics (@chapter-ref{chap:design})
 that does not rely on higher-order wrappers or full run-time checks.
Instead, @|stransient| uses light ``shape checks'' throughout typed code.
One would expect fast performance from @|stransient| on mixed-typed code.
The first-ever evaluation, however, only reports data for untyped and fully-typed
 programs@~cite{vss-popl-2017}.

This section presents a systematic evaluation of
 Reticulated without its experimental blame algorithm@~cite{gm-pepm-2018}.
The data offers a big-picture view of @|stransient|,
 further validates the approximate method,
 and identifies bugs in the measured version of Reticulated.
Overall, @|stransient| checks never exceed a 10x slowdown in the benchmarks.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:rp:protocol"]{Protocol}

@parag{Granularity}
The granularity of this evaluation is @emph{function and class fields}.
One syntactic unit in the experiment is either one function,
 one method, or the collection of all fields for one class.
@Figure-ref{fig:rp:example-class} demonstrates this granularity with
 a simple Reticulated module.
The class @tt{Cash} has two fields and one method that requires three arguments;
 the module also include a function that instantiates a @tt{Cash} object with exactly
 5 dollars.
Reticulated permits the removal of every type in the figure, giving
 @${128} possible configurations.
The granularity for our experiment, however, explores the @${8} configurations
 obtained by removing types from the field declaration, the method, and/or the
 function each as a complete unit.

    )]
]

@parag{Data Collection}
The data is exhaustive for benchmarks with at most @$|{2^{17}}| configurations
 and approximate for larger benchmarks.
The approximations use @integer->word[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS] samples
 each containing @${@id[SAMPLE-RATE]\!*\!(F + C)} configurations,
 where @${F} is the number of functions in the benchmark and
 @${C} is the number of classes.

All data comes from jobs that we ran on the
 @hyperlink["https://kb.iu.edu/d/bezu"]{@emph{Karst at Indiana University}}
 computing cluster.
Each job:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{

  ran the configuration's main module @id[rp:NUM-ITERATIONS] times,
  and recorded the result of each run.

  @rp:render-ratios-table[rp:RT]
]

@elem{
The table in @figure-ref{fig:rp:ratio} lists the endpoints of migratory typing in
 Reticulated.
From left to right, these are:
 the performance of the untyped configuration relative to the Python baseline (the @id[rp:u/p-ratio]),
 the performance of the fully-typed configuration relative to the untyped configuration (the @id[rp:t/u-ratio]),
 and the overall delta between fully-typed and Python (the @id[rp:t/p-ratio]).

For example, the row for @bm{futen} reports a @|rp:u/p-ratio| of @${@|futen-u/p|}.
This means that the average time to run the untyped configuration of the
 @bm{futen} benchmark using Reticulated is that much slower than the
 average time of running the same code using Python.
The @|rp:t/u-ratio| for @bm{futen} states that the fully-typed configuration
 is @${@|futen-t/u|} times slower than the untyped configuration.

Migrating a benchmark to Reticulated, or from untyped to fully-typed, always
 adds performance overhead.
This overhead is always within one order of magnitude.

@; Regarding the @|rp:u/p-ratio|s:
@;  @integer->word[rp-<2] are below @${2}x,
@;  @integer->word[(- rp-<3 rp-<2)] are between @${2}x and @${3}x, and
@;  the remaining @integer->word[(- rp-<4.5 rp-<3)] are below @${4.5}x.
@; The @|rp:t/u-ratio|s are typically lower:
@;  @integer->word[tr-<2] are below @${2}x,
@;  @integer->word[(- tr-<3 tr-<2)] are between @${2}x and @${3}x,
@;  and the final @integer->word[(- tr-<3.5 tr-<3)] are below @${3.5}x.

@Integer->word[num->] benchmarks have @|rp:u/p-ratio|s that are larger
 than their @|rp:t/u-ratio|s.
One would expect @|rp:u/p-ratio|s close to 1 because
 untyped Reticulated need not differ from Python.
But Reticulated duplicates some of Python's run-time checks.
For example, Reticulated checks that a method is bound before proceeding
 with method dispatch.

  rp:cache-dir
]

@Figures-ref["fig:rp:overhead" (exact-ceiling (/ (length rp:MAIN-BENCHMARKS)
 overhead-plots-per-page))] summarize the overhead of migratory typing in the
 benchmark programs.
Each plot reports the percent of @ddeliverable[] configurations (@|y-axis|)
 for values of @${D} between @${1}x overhead and @${@id[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD]}x overhead (@|x-axis|).
The heading above a plot states the benchmark's name and indicates whether the
 data is exhaustive or approximate.
Exhaustive plots show the total number of configurations.
Approximate plots show the number of samples
 and the number of randomly-selected configurations in each sample.

The curves for the approximate data---@bm{sample_fsm}, @bm{aespython}, and @bm{stats}---are intervals
 rather than fixed-width lines.
For instance, the height of an interval at @${x\!=\!4} is the range of the
 @sraapproximation[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS (format "[~a(F+C)]" SAMPLE-RATE) "95"]
 for the number of @ddeliverable[4] configurations.
These intervals are thin because there is little variance in the proportion
 of @ddeliverable{D} configurations across the @integer->word[NUM-SAMPLE-TRIALS]
 samples, but the @bm{sample_fsm} curve is slightly thicker than the
 @bm{aespython} curve.

Curves in these figures typically cover a large area and reach the
 top of the @|y-axis| at a low value of @${D}.
This value is always less than @${@id[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD]}.
In other words, every configuration in the
 experiment is @ddeliverable[rp:MAX-OVERHEAD].
For many benchmarks, the maximum overhead is significantly lower.

None of the configurations in the experiment run faster than the Python baseline.
This is to be expected, given the @|rp:u/p-ratio|s in @figure-ref{fig:rp:ratio} and the
 fact that Reticulated translates type annotations into run-time checks.

    The plots for the other @integer->word[(- rp:NUM-EXHAUSTIVE-BENCHMARKS (length smooth))]
     benchmarks have wide, flat segments.
    These flat segments are due to functions that are frequently executed
     in the benchmarks' traces; all configurations in which one of these functions
     is typed incur a significant performance overhead.

@section{Additional Visualizations}

The methods presented in this chapter are our most effective answer
 to the question of how to evaluate the performance of a mixed-typed language.
In particular, the notion of @ddeliverable{} configurations is a
 clear and scalable way to summarize performance.
But a mixed-typed language has other interesting properties.
This section presents visualizations that help answer different, targeted
 questions.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:perf:exact"]{Exact Runtime Plots}

@(let* ((bm-name 'nqueens)

  exact-long-caption
  rp:render-exact-plot
  (list bm-name)
  #f]
@elem{
The raw data behind an overhead plot is a sequence of running times for
 every configuration.
An overhead plot summarizes the running times into an average, and uses
 these averages to group configurations into buckets.
Unfortunately, this method hides outliers in the data
 and syntactic relations (think back to the lattice, @figure-ref{fig:example-lattice-0})
 among configurations.

@Figure-ref{fig:example-exact-plot} addresses both concerns.
Instead of summarizing one configuration with its average runtime,
 the plot contains one point for every running time in the dataset.
These points are spread left-to-right in one of the @integer->word[(+ 1 num-units)]
 columns of the figure.
If a plot like this does not consist of distinct, horizontal lines, the
 underlying dataset may have irregular running times.
Each column contains all configurations that have the same number of types.
In terms of the configuration lattice (@figure-ref{fig:example-lattice-0}),
 the left-most column contains the bottom level and each successive column
 present a higher levels.
At a glance, @figure-ref{fig:example-exact-plot} therefore shows the overall
 effect of adding types.
}])


@subsection{Relative Scatterplots}

@(let ((bm-name 'morsecode)) @list[
@figure*[

  @elem{Scatterplot comparing @bm[bm-name] configurations before
   and after collapsible contracts.
   The @|x-axis| ranges over collapsible overhead and the @|y-axis|

   A point @${(x, y)} is a head-to-head comparison;
    points above the diagonal are better for collapsible.
  }
  (tr:render-scatterplot-example bm-name)
]

@elem{
Collapsible contracts are a new representation for @|sdeep| run-time type
 checks@~cite{fgsfs-oopsla-2018}.
The representation greatly improves some mixed-typed programs, but can
 slow down others.
To assess the implementation of collapsible,
 we used a scatterplot technique due to Spenser Bauman@~cite{bbst-oopsla-2017}.
@Figure-ref{fig:example-scatterplot} shows one representative example from our work.
Each point in the scatterplot shows how collapsible affects one configuration.
Points above the diagonal line are improved;
 points below the line get worse with collapsible contracts.
More precisely, a point @${(X, Y)} shows the overhead in both systems.
The first coordinate, @${X}, is the overhead with collapsible.
The @${Y} coordinate is the baseline overhead, without collapsible.
If collapsible always led to a lower overhead, then all
 point would lie above the @${X=Y} line (because @${X < Y}).

@elem{
The plots in @section-ref{sec:tr:evaluation} paint a bleak picture of
 Typed Racket.
Many benchmarks have many configurations that run far slower than the
 untyped code.
A natural question, though, is whether these results are brittle.
If a programmer can escape the slow configurations by converting one or
 two more modules, then the bleak conclusion may be unwarranted.

@Figure-ref{fig:example-path} presents two plots for the @bm[bm-name] benchmark
 that compare the original data against the best-possible performance after
 converting additional modules.
In the top plot, a configuration is @ddeliverable{X} in the orange curve
 if it can reach a @ddeliverable{X} configuration from the blue curve after
 adding types to one module.
Similarly, the bottom plot shows the best-possible performance after typing
 two untyped modules.

The plots show that significant improvements are possible, but not guaranteed
 even in the best case.
Other large benchmarks typically show similar patterns@~cite{gtnffvf-jfp-2019}.
