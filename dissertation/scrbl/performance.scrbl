@title{Performance}

@summary{
  A sound gradual type system ensures that untyped components of a program can
   never break the guarantees of statically typed components.
  This assurance relies on runtime checks, which in turn impose performance
   overhead in proportion to the frequency and nature of interaction between
   typed and untyped components.

  This chapter presents the first systematic method for evaluating the
   performance of sound gradual type systems.
  The method quantifies both the absolute performance of a gradual type system
   and the relative performance of two implementations of the same gradual type
   system.
  To validate the method, the chapter reports on its application to
   @integer->word[(*NUM-BENCHMARKS*)] programs and @integer->word[(length (*RKT-VERSIONS*))]
   implementations of Typed Racket.

@section{Exhaustive Evaluation Method}

A performance evaluation of gradual type systems must reflect how programmers
 use such systems.
Since experience with Typed Racket shows that programmers frequently combine
 typed and untyped code within an application, an evaluation method must account
 for the large space of code between untyped and fully-typed programs.
These applications may also undergo gradual transitions that add or remove some
 type annotations.
In a typical evolution, programmers compare the performance of the modified
 program with the previous version.
If type-driven optimizations result in a performance improvement, all is well.
Otherwise, the programmer may need to address the performance overhead.
As they continue to develop the application, programmers repeat this process.
Again, an evaluation method must take into account gradual evolution to reflect
 practice.

The following subsections build an evaluation method from these observations in
 three steps.
First, @secref{sec:method:lattice} describes the space over which a performance
 evaluation must take place.
Second, @secref{sec:measurements} defines metrics relevant to the performance
 of a gradually typed program.
Third, @secref{sec:graphs} introduces a visualization that concisely presents
 the metrics on exponentially large spaces.

@;The promise of Typed Racket's macro-level gradual typing is that programmers can add types to any subset of the modules in an untyped program.
@;In principle, this promise extends to third-party libraries and modules from the Racket runtime system, but in practice a programmer has no control over such modules.
@;Thus we distinguish between two kinds of modules: the @emph{migratable} modules that a programmer may add types to, and the @emph{contextual} modules in the software ecosystem, which remain unchanged.
@;A comprehensive performance evaluation must therefore consider the @emph{configurations} a programmer could possibly create given type annotations for each migratable module.
@;These configurations form a lattice, ordered by the subset relation on the set of typed modules in a configuration.
@;
@;@Figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice} demonstrates one such lattice for a program with @|suffixtree-num-modules| migratable modules.
@;The black rectangle at the top of the lattice represents the configuration in which all @|suffixtree-num-modules| modules are typed.
@;The other @id[(sub1 suffixtree-num-configs)] rectangles represent configurations with some untyped modules.
@;
@;A given row in the lattice groups configurations with the same number of typed modules (black squares).
@;For instance, configurations in the second row from the bottom contain two typed modules.
@;These represent all possible ways of converting two modules in the untyped configuration to Typed Racket.
@;Similarly, configurations in the third row represent all possible configurations a programmer might encounter after applying three such @emph{type conversion steps} to the untyped configuration.
@;In general, let the notation @exact{$c_1 \rightarrow_k c_2$} express the idea that a programmer starting from configuration @exact{$c_1$} (in row @exact{$i$}) could reach configuration @exact{$c_2$} (in row @exact{$j$}) after taking at most @exact{$k$} type conversion steps (@exact{$j - i \le k$}).
@;
@;Configurations in @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice} are furthermore labeled
@; with their performance overhead relative to the untyped configuration on Racket
@; version 6.2.
@;With these labels, a language implementor can draw several conclusions about
@; the performance overhead of gradual typing in this program.
@;For instance, @|suffixtree-num-D-str| configurations run within a
@; @id[suffixtree-sample-D]x overhead.
@; @; and @|suffixtree-num-k-str| configurations
@; @; are at most @integer->word[suffixtree-sample-k] type conversion step from a
@; @; configuration that runs within a @id[suffixtree-sample-D]x overhead.
@;High overheads are common (@id[suffixtree-num-max] configurations have over
@; @id[suffixtree-max]x overhead), but the fully typed configuration runs faster
@; (0.7x overhead) than the untyped configuration because Typed Racket uses the
@; type annotations to compile efficient bytecode.
@;
@;A labeled lattice such as @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice} is a @emph{performance lattice}.
@;The same lattice without labels is a @emph{configuration lattice}.
@;Practically speaking, users of a gradual type system explore configuration lattices and maintainers of such systems may use performance lattices to evaluate overall performance.
@;
@;
@;@; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@;@section[#:tag "sec:measurements"]{Performance Metrics}
@;
@;The most basic question, and least important, about a gradually typed language is
@; how fast fully-typed programs are in comparison to their fully untyped relative.
@;In principle and in Typed Racket, static types enable optimizations and can serve in place of runtime tag checks.
@;The net effect of such improvements may, however, be offset by the runtime cost of enforcing type soundness.
@;Relative performance is therefore best described as a ratio, to capture the possibility of speedups and slowdowns.@;
@;@;
@;    @def[#:term "typed/untyped ratio"]{
@;     The typed/untyped ratio of a performance
@;      lattice is the time needed to run the top (fully typed) configuration divided by the
@;      time needed to run the bottom (untyped) configuration.
@;    }@;
@;@;
@;For users of a gradual type system, the important performance
@; question is how much overhead their current configuration suffers.
@; @; RELATIVE TO previous version (standardized as "untyped program")
@;If the performance overhead is low enough, programmers can release the
@; configuration to clients.
@;Depending on the nature of the application, some developers might not accept any performance overhead.
@;Others may be willing to tolerate an order-of-magnitude slowdown.
@;The following parameterized definition of a deliverable configuration accounts for these varying requirements.@;
@;@;
@;    @def[#:term @list{@deliverable{}}]{
@;     A configuration
@;      is @deliverable{} if its performance is no worse than a
@;      factor of @math{D} slowdown compared to the untyped configuration.
@;     @;A program is @deliverable{} if all its configurations are @deliverable{}.
@;    }@;
@;@;
@;@; NOTE: really should be using %, but Sec 4 shows why stick to x
@;@;
@;If an application is currently in a non-@deliverable[] configuration,
@; the next question is how much work a team must invest to reach a
@; @deliverable[] configuration.
@;One coarse measure of ``work'' is the number of additional modules that must be annotated with types before performance improves.@;
@;@;
@;    @def[#:term @list{@step{}}]{
@;     A configuration @exact{$c_1$} is @step[] if @exact{$c_1 \rightarrow_k c_2$}
@;      and @exact{$c_2$} is @deliverable{}.
@;    }@;
@;@; @profile-point{sec:method:example}
@;The number of @step[] configurations captures the experience of a prescient programmer that converts the @exact{$k$} modules that maximize the performance improvement.

@;
@;Let us illustrate these terms with an example.

@;Furthermore, suppose half the mixed configurations run in
@;  approximately @id[(sample-data 'c001)] seconds and the other half run in approximately @id[(sample-data 'c011)] seconds.
@;@Figure-ref{fig:demo-lattice} is a performance lattice for this hypothetical program.
@;The label below each configuration is its overhead relative to the untyped configuration.
@;
@;@(let* ([tu-ratio (/ (sample-data 'c111) (sample-data 'c000))]
@;        [t-str @id[(sample-overhead 'c111)]]

@;        [min-g (inexact->exact (apply max (take g-overheads 3)))]
@;        [max-g (inexact->exact (apply max g-overheads))])
@;  @elem{
@;    The typed/untyped ratio is @id[tu-ratio],
@;     indicating a performance improvement due to adding types.
@;    The typed configuration is also
@;      @deliverable[t-str]
@;      because it runs within a @elem[t-str]x
@;      slowdown relative to the untyped configuration.
@;    All mixed configurations are
@;      @deliverable[@id[max-g]], but only three are, e.g.,
@;      @deliverable[@id[min-g]].
@;    Lastly, the mixed configurations are all @step["2" t-str]
@;     because they can reach the typed configuration in at most two type conversion steps.
@;  })
@;
@;The ratio of @deliverable{D} configurations in a performance lattice is a measure of
@; the overall feasibility of gradual typing.
@;When this ratio is high, then no matter how the application evolves, performance
@; is likely to remain acceptable.
@;Conversely, a low ratio implies that a team may struggle to recover performance after
@; typing a few modules.
@;Practitioners with a fixed performance requirement @math{D} can therefore use the number
@; of @deliverable[] configurations to extrapolate the performance of a gradual type system.

@;        Although a performance lattice contains a comprehensive description of performance overhead, it does not effectively communicate this information.
@;        It is difficult to tell, at a glance, whether a program has good or bad performance relative to its users' requirements.
@;        Comparing the relative performance of two or more lattices is also difficult and is in practice limited to programs with an extremely small number of modules.
@;
@;        The main lesson to extract from a performance lattice is the proportion of @step{} configurations for various @math{k} and @math{D}.
@;        In other words, this proportion describes the number of configurations (out of the entire lattice) that are at most @math{k} upward steps from a @deliverable{D} configuration.
@;        One way to plot this information is to fix a value for @math{k}, say @math{k=0}, and consider a set of values @exact{$d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1}$} for @math{D}.
@;        The set of proportions of @step["0" "d_i"] configurations defines a cumulative distribution function with the value of @math{D} on the independent axis and the proportion of configurations on the dependent axis.
@;
@;        @Figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-plot} demonstrates two such @emph{overhead plots}, summarizing the data in @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice}.
@;        @; TODO awkward
@;        Specifically, each plots the @|suffixtree-num-configs-str| configurations of a program called @bm[suffixtree] using data measured on Racket v@|suffixtree-lattice-version|.
@;        The plot on the left fixes @math{k=0} and plots the proportion of @step["0" "D"] configurations.
@;        The plot on the right fixes @math{k=1} and plots the proportion of @step["1" "D"] configurations.
@;        Both plots consider @math{@id[ALOT]} values of @math{D} evenly spaced between 1x and 20x.
@;        The line on each plot represents the cumulative distribution function.
@;        The x-axis is log scaled to focus on low overheads.
@;
@;        The plot on the left, in which @math{k=0}, confirms the observation made in @secref{sec:method:lattice} that @(id (round (* 100 (/ suffixtree-num-D suffixtree-num-configs))))% of the @|suffixtree-num-configs-str| configurations (@|suffixtree-num-D-str| configurations) run within a @id[suffixtree-sample-D]x overhead.
@;        For values of @math{D} larger than 2x, the proportion of @deliverable{D} configurations is slightly larger, but even at a @id[MAX-OVERHEAD]x overhead, this proportion is only @(id (round (* 100 (/ suffixtree-num-D-max suffixtree-num-configs))))%.
@;        The plot on the right shows that the proportion of @step["1" "D"] is typically twice as high as the proportion of @deliverable{} configurations for this benchmark.
@;
@;        This presentation scales to arbitrarily large programs because the @math{y}-axis plots the proportion of @deliverable{D} configurations; in contrast, a performance lattice contains exponentially many nodes.

@;      }
@;)))
@;
@;@subsection{Assumptions and Limitations}
@;
@;Plots in the style of @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-plot} rest on two assumptions and have two significant limitations, which readers must keep in mind as they interpret the results.
@;
@;@; - assn: log scale
@;The @emph{first assumption} is that configurations with less than 2x overhead are significantly
@; more practical than configurations with a 10x overhead or more.
@;Hence the plots use a log-scaled x-axis
@; to simultaneously encourage fine-grained comparison in the 1.2x to 1.6x overhead range
@; and blur the distinction between, e.g., 14x and 18x slowdowns.
@;
@;@; Zorn: 30% of execution time in storage management "represent the worst-case overhead that that might be expected to be associated with garbage collection."
@;
@;@; - assn: 20x
@;The @emph{second assumption} is that configurations with more than 20x
@; overhead are completely unusable in practice.
@;Pathologies like the 100x slowdowns in @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice}
@; represent a challenge for implementors, but if these overheads suddenly
@; dropped to 30x, the configurations would still be useless to developers.
@;
@;@; - assn: ok to take means
@;@; meh whocares
@;
@;@; - limit: no identity, no relation between configs (where is typed?)
@;The @emph{first limitation} of the overhead plots is that they do not report the number of types in a configuration.
@;The one exception is the fully-typed configuration; its overhead is given explicitly through the typed/untyped ratio above the left plot.
@;
@;@; - limit: angelic choice
@;The @emph{second limitation} is that the @step{1} plot does not show how we
@; optimistically chose the best type conversion step.
@;In a program with @math{N} modules, a programmer has at most @math{N} type conversion steps to choose from,
@; some of which may not lead to a @deliverable[] configuration.
@;For example, there are six configurations with exactly one typed module in @figure-ref{fig:suffixtree-lattice} but only one of these is @deliverable{1}.
@;
