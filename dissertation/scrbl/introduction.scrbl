@title{What It's All About}

@; summary:
@; Languages that can mix typed and untyped code must come with a way to
@;  fine-tune the strength of types.
@; Part 1 = Performance analysis demonstrates the need for tuning.
@; Part 2 = Design-space analysis shows possible strengths.
@; Part 3 = Implements one tunable language, demonstrates benefits.
@;
@; ... gee do we want parts in this book after all?

Short intro to gradual typing, assumptions, gradual versus migratory.

Thesis statement:

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
 Honest and lying types can coexist in a way that preserves their formal
 properties; programmers can combine these types to strengthen lying-type
 guarantees, avoid unimportant honest-type runtime errors, and lower the
 running time of typed/untyped interactions.
}
