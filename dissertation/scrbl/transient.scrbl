The high cost of @|sdeep| types calls for an alternative semantics
 with @|sshallow| types.
Of the vetted alternatives (@chapter-ref{chap:design}), @|stransient| is the
 most promising.
@|sTransient| offers a basic soundness guarantee,
 requires a low implementation effort,
 and easily supports any combination of typed and untyped code.
Furthermore, the data for Reticulated Python suggests that the overhead
 of @|stransient| run-time checks never exceeds a 10x slowdown (@chapter-ref{chap:performance}).

This chapter presents a @|stransient| semantics for Typed Racket.
Adapting the theory to the Typed Racket language required a generalization to
 macro-level gradual typing and several insights to handle a richer
 language of static types (@sectionref{sec:transient:theory}).
In the course of this work, I also adapted the blame algorithm
 of @citet{vss-popl-2017} and identified several challenges (@sectionref{sec:transient:blame});
 first and foremost, the basic algorithm is prohibitively slow.
The final implementation does not include blame; that said, the implementation
 takes care to reuse large parts of Typed Racket, including the static
 type checker and most of the type-driven optimizer (@sectionref{sec:transient:implementation}).

Henceforth, @|sDeep| Racket refers to the original, @|snatural| implementation
 and @|sShallow| Racket refers to my @|stransient| implementation.
Typed Racket refers to the common, static parts; namely, the surface language
 and type system.

The performance of @|sShallow| Racket is typically an improvement over
 @|sDeep| Racket, but both semantics have distinct strengths (@sectionref{sec:transient:performance}).
@|sTransient| always adds overhead relative to untyped Racket, but is the
 safer bet for mixed-typed programs.
@|sNatural| has better performance in programs with large chunks of typed
 code, and surpasses untyped Racket in many cases.
Whether @|sShallow| Racket can ever run faster than untyped code is an open
 question; there are several avenues worth exploring (@sectionref{sec:transient:future}).

@citet{vss-popl-2017} present a first @|stransient| semantics.
This semantics helped me understand the behavior of Reticulated Python
 and the key ideas behind @|stransient|.
Three characteristics of the semantics, however, make it unsuitable for
 a @|stransient| implementation in Racket:
 it includes a dynamic type,
 it does not include a subtyping relation,
 and its type checker is intertwined with the @emph{completion} pass
 that rewrites typed code.
This section outlines the design of a suitable model and its properties.
Scaling the new model up to the full Typed Racket language raised questions
 about how to enforce intricate types.
@Section-ref{sec:transient:theory:types} explains my design and a few
 alternatives.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:dyn"]{From Micro to Macro}

Reticulated Python provides a dynamic type in the micro gradual typing
 tradition.
Consequently, every type-checking rule must accomodate the dynamic type
 in addition to the expected type.

Typed Racket does not have a dynamic type; instead it adds run-time tools
 so that a non-dynamic type system can make assumptions about untyped input.
Using this macro approach, only a handful of typing rules need to deal
 with dynamically-typed values.

The differences between micro and macro typing rules have implications
 for @|stransient| run-time checks.
In the original semantics, the evaluation of any expression could bring
 a dynamically-typed value into a typed context.
In a macro semantics, only boundaries and elimination forms can introduce
 an untyped value.
@Figure-ref{fig:transient:app-compare} illustrates the difference by contrasting
 the @|stransient| checks needed for a function application.
On the top, the micro approach requires three checks: two checks in case
 the function and argument are dynamically-typed, and one to validate the
 shape of the result.
On the bottom, macro without blame requires only the result check.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:app-compare"
  @elem{
   @|sTransient| completion rules for an application under micro (top) and
   macro (bottom) gradual typing.
   Both rules insert run-time shape checks.
   The micro rule depends on a type coercion (@${\scoerce})
   metafunction@~cite{vss-popl-2017}.
  }
  @exact|{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[lab=Micro]{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0 : \stype_0 \compilesto \sexpr_0'
        \\
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_1 : \stype_1 \compilesto \sexpr_1'
        \\\\
        \stype_0~\scoerce~\tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3}
      }{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0~\sexpr_1 : \stype_3
        \compilesto
        \echeckone{\stype_3}{((\echeckone{(\tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3})}{\sexpr_0'})~(\echeckone{\stype_2}{\sexpr_1'}))}
      }

      \inferrule*[lab=Macro]{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0 : \tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3} \compilesto \sexpr_0'
        \\
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_1 : \stype_2 \compilesto \sexpr_1'
      }{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0~\sexpr_1 : \stype_3
        \compilesto
        \echeckone{\stype_3}{(\sexpr_0'~\sexpr_1')}
      }
    \end{mathpar}
  }|
]

Adding blame to macro adds the need for an additional blame-map operation
 in @figure-ref{fig:transient:app-compare}, but no additional checks.
The blame map potentially needs an update because the argument flows
 in to the function.
There is no need for a check because the argument has a non-dynamic type.

Other rules can be simplified in a similar fashion.
The benefits are two-fold:
 macro programs have fewer run-time checks to slow them down,
 and programmers have fewer places to search if a program manifests a
 boundary error.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:subt"]{Subtyping}

A type system for untyped code must either include a subtyping
 judgment or force programmers to rewrite their data definitions.
Rewriting takes time and invites mistakes, therefore a type system
 that supports migratory typing (@chapter-ref{chap:why}) needs a subtyping
 judgment.

The dynamic type is not enough because it cannot articulate designs.
For example, the untyped @codett{divide} function in @figure-ref{fig:transient:divide}
 either divides two numbers or returns the symbol @tt{'undef} if the divisor
 is zero.
Typed Racket lets a programmer express this ad-hoc union of two base types.
By contrast, the dynamic type can summarize the result but provides no information
 to callers.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:divide"
  @elem{Untyped division function with exactly two kinds of output.}
  transient:divide]

Adapting @|stransient| to include subtyping was therefore an essential task
 for @|sShallow| Racket.
The addition was straightforward, but revealed a surprising distinction
 between declaration-site types and use-site types; @|stransient| with
 subtyping may miss certain type mistakes!
@Figure-ref{fig:transient:subtype} illustrates the pitfall of @|stransient|
 subtyping with a lazy factorial function.
This typed function asks for a thunk that computes a non-negative number
 and returns a thunk that computes a factorial.
Because of the type declaration on @codett{lazy-n}, it looks like @|stransient|
 should check that the call @codett{(lazy-n)} returns a non-negative number.
The actual behavior, however, depends on the type of the call expression.
If the language replaces the placeholder @codett{???} with the valid type
 @codett{Integer}, then @|stransient| checks for an integer and the untyped
 code at the bottom of the figure enters an infinite loop.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:subtype"
  @elem{Lazy factorial function, may diverge under @|stransient|.}
  transient:subtype]

In summary, the flexibility of subtyping limits the ability of @|stransient|
 checks to find mismatches due to type boundaries.
Checks are based on local uses, while boundaries are claims with a broad scope.

@futurework{
  Find an effective way to offer subtyping and catch boundary errors.
  One idea is to use static analysis to identify the different paths from
   boundaries to a use-site.
  A second is to record subtyping actions in the blame map, as a loss of precision.
  The extra metadata, however, will not prevent @codett{lazy-fact} from diverging.

@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:completion"]{Correct Completion}

Original Retic paper states a translation.
To arrive at a similar translation in our completely-different context,
 need criteria.
Phrase as completion.
Ours is simple, can ask about minimal.
