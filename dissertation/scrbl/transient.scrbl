The high cost of @|sdeep| types calls for an alternative semantics
 with @|sshallow| types.
Of the vetted alternatives (@chapter-ref{chap:design}), @|stransient| is the
 most promising.
@|sTransient| offers a basic soundness guarantee,
 requires a low implementation effort,
 and easily supports any combination of typed and untyped code.
Furthermore, the data for Reticulated Python suggests that the overhead
 of @|stransient| run-time checks never exceeds a 10x slowdown (@chapter-ref{chap:performance}).

This chapter presents a @|stransient| semantics for Typed Racket.
Adapting the theory to the Typed Racket language required a generalization to
 macro-level gradual typing and several insights to handle a richer
 language of static types (@sectionref{sec:transient:theory}).
In the course of this work, I also adapted the blame algorithm
 of @citet{vss-popl-2017} and identified several challenges (@sectionref{sec:transient:blame});
 first and foremost, the basic algorithm is prohibitively slow.
The final implementation does not include blame; that said, the implementation
 takes care to reuse large parts of Typed Racket, including the static
 type checker and most of the type-driven optimizer (@sectionref{sec:transient:implementation}).

Henceforth, @|sDeep| Racket refers to the original, @|snatural| implementation
 and @|sShallow| Racket refers to my @|stransient| implementation.
Typed Racket refers to the common, static parts; namely, the surface language
 and type system.

The performance of @|sShallow| Racket is typically an improvement over
 @|sDeep| Racket, but both semantics have distinct strengths (@sectionref{sec:transient:performance}).
@|sTransient| always adds overhead relative to untyped Racket, but is the
 safer bet for mixed-typed programs.
@|sNatural| has better performance in programs with large chunks of typed
 code, and surpasses untyped Racket in many cases.
Whether @|sShallow| Racket can ever run faster than untyped code is an open
 question; there are several avenues worth exploring (@sectionref{sec:transient:future}).

@citet{vss-popl-2017} present a first @|stransient| semantics.
This semantics helped me understand the behavior of Reticulated Python
 and the key ideas behind @|stransient|.
Three characteristics of the semantics, however, make it unsuitable for
 a @|stransient| implementation in Racket:
 it includes a dynamic type,
 it does not include a subtyping relation,
 and its type checker is intertwined with the @emph{completion} pass
 that rewrites typed code.
This section outlines the design of a suitable model and its properties.
Scaling the new model up to the full Typed Racket language raised questions
 about how to enforce types.
@Section-ref{sec:transient:theory:types} explains my design and a few
 alternatives.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:types"]{Run-Time Behaviors for Static Types}

The main design choices for @|sShallow| Racket concern the run-time checks
 that enforce types.
In terms of the model, there is a rich language @${\stype} of static types
 and the problem is to define a type-shape interpretation @${\tagof{\stype}} for
 each.
A shape must be decidable; for example,
 @${\tagof{\tfun{\tint}{\tint}} = \tfun{\tint}{\tint}} is unacceptable
 without a predicate that can decide whether an untyped function always
 returns an integer when applied to an integer.
Beyond decidability, type-shapes should be fast to test and imply useful
 properties.
Shape soundness should help a programmer debug a faulty program
 and should enable shape-directed optimizations.

The original @|stransient| model suggests that type-shapes must be decidable
 in constant time@~cite{vss-popl-2017}.
Namely, the only type constructors are for reference cells and functions,
 both of which are easily recognized in a dynamically-typed language.
Following this restriction would severely limit @|stransient| type systems.
Indeed, Reticulated Python goes beyond the constant-time suggestion with
 object types.
The type-shape for an object with @${N} fields/methods checks for the presence
 of each member.
Thus, the cost is linear in the size of an object type.

@|sShallow| Racket includes other non-constant shapes in addition to
 classes and objects.
In general, the goal is to enforce full type constructors.
The type-shape for a function checks arity; for example,
 the types @${(\tfun{\tint}{\tnat})} and @${(\tfun{\tint\,\tint}{\tnat})}
 have different shapes.
The shape for a sized vector checks length.
And the shape for a list checks for a null-terminated sequence of pairs.
Not all types correspond to value constructors, though.
These type @emph{connectives}@~cite{cl-icfp-2017,clps-popl-2019} call for
 a recursive interpretation:
 for example, @${\tagof{\stype_0 \cup \stype_1} = \tagof{\stype_0} \cup \tagof{\stype_1}}
 and @${\tagof{\fforall{\alpha_0}{\stype_0}} = \tagof{\stype_0}}.
Type variables have trivial shapes, @${\tagof{\alpha_0} = \top}.
@Section-ref{sec:transient:types} goes into more detail about the implementation.

@futurework{
  Is there a different way to enforce universal types that offers stronger
   reasoning principles, in the spirit of parametricity?
}


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:dyn"]{From Micro to Macro}

Reticulated Python provides a dynamic type in the micro gradual typing
 tradition.
Consequently, every type-checking rule must accomodate the dynamic type
 in addition to the expected type.

Typed Racket does not have a dynamic type; instead it adds run-time tools
 so that a non-dynamic type system can make assumptions about untyped input.
Using this macro approach, only a handful of typing rules need to deal
 with dynamically-typed values.

The differences between micro and macro typing rules have implications
 for @|stransient| run-time checks.
In the original semantics, the evaluation of any expression could bring
 a dynamically-typed value into a typed context.
In a macro semantics, only boundaries and elimination forms can introduce
 an untyped value.
@Figure-ref{fig:transient:app-compare} illustrates the difference by contrasting
 the @|stransient| checks needed for a function application.
On the top, the micro approach requires three checks: two checks in case
 the function and argument are dynamically-typed, and one to validate the
 shape of the result.
On the bottom, macro without blame requires only the result check.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:app-compare"
  @elem{
   @|sTransient| completion rules for an application under micro (top) and
   macro (bottom) gradual typing.
   Both rules insert run-time shape checks.
   The micro rule depends on a type coercion (@${\scoerce})
   metafunction@~cite{vss-popl-2017}.
  }
  @exact|{
    \begin{mathpar}
      \inferrule*[lab=Micro]{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0 : \stype_0 \compilesto \sexpr_0'
        \\
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_1 : \stype_1 \compilesto \sexpr_1'
        \\\\
        \stype_0~\scoerce~\tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3}
      }{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0~\sexpr_1 : \stype_3
        \compilesto
        \echeckone{\stype_3}{((\echeckone{(\tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3})}{\sexpr_0'})~(\echeckone{\stype_2}{\sexpr_1'}))}
      }

      \inferrule*[lab=Macro]{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0 : \tfun{\stype_2}{\stype_3} \compilesto \sexpr_0'
        \\
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_1 : \stype_2 \compilesto \sexpr_1'
      }{
        \stypeenv_0 \sWT \sexpr_0~\sexpr_1 : \stype_3
        \compilesto
        \echeckone{\stype_3}{(\sexpr_0'~\sexpr_1')}
      }
    \end{mathpar}
  }|
]

Adding blame to macro adds the need for an additional blame-map operation
 in @figure-ref{fig:transient:app-compare}, but no additional checks.
The blame map potentially needs an update because the argument flows
 in to the function.
There is no need for a check because the argument has a non-dynamic type.

Other rules can be simplified in a similar fashion.
The benefits are two-fold:
 macro programs have fewer run-time checks to slow them down,
 and programmers have fewer places to search if a program manifests a
 boundary error.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:subt"]{Adding Subtyping}

A type system for untyped code must either include a subtyping
 judgment or force programmers to rewrite their data definitions.
Rewriting takes time and invites mistakes, therefore a type system
 that supports migratory typing (@chapter-ref{chap:why}) needs a subtyping
 judgment.

The dynamic type is not enough because it cannot articulate designs.
For example, the untyped @codett{divide} function in @figure-ref{fig:transient:divide}
 either divides two numbers or returns the symbol @tt{'undef} if the divisor
 is zero.
Typed Racket lets a programmer express this ad-hoc union of two base types.
By contrast, the dynamic type can summarize the result but provides no information
 to callers.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:divide"
  @elem{Untyped division function with exactly two kinds of output.}
  transient:divide]

Adapting @|stransient| to include subtyping was therefore an essential task
 for @|sShallow| Racket.
The addition was straightforward, but revealed a surprising distinction
 between declaration-site types and use-site types; @|stransient| with
 subtyping may miss certain type mistakes!
@Figure-ref{fig:transient:subtype} illustrates the pitfall of @|stransient|
 subtyping with a lazy factorial function.
This typed function asks for a thunk that computes a non-negative number
 and returns a thunk that computes a factorial.
Because of the type declaration on @codett{lazy-n}, it looks like @|stransient|
 should check that the call @codett{(lazy-n)} returns a non-negative number.
The actual behavior, however, depends on the type of the call expression.
If the language replaces the placeholder @codett{???} with the valid type
 @codett{Integer}, then @|stransient| checks for an integer and the untyped
 code at the bottom of the figure enters an infinite loop.

@figure*[
  "fig:transient:subtype"
  @elem{Lazy factorial function, may diverge under @|stransient|.}
  transient:subtype]

In summary, the flexibility of subtyping limits the ability of @|stransient|
 checks to find mismatches due to type boundaries.
Checks are based on local uses, while boundaries are claims with a broad scope.

@futurework{
  Find an effective way to offer subtyping and catch boundary errors.
  One idea is to use static analysis to identify the different paths from
   boundaries to a use-site.
  A second is to record subtyping actions in the blame map, as a loss of precision.
  The extra metadata, however, will not prevent @codett{lazy-fact} from diverging.
}


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:theory:completion"]{From Elaboration to Completion}

@citet{vss-popl-2017} intertwine typing and @|stransient| checks in a
 type-elaboration judgment.
The combination is a good fit for an implementation because check-insertion
 depends on static types, and one pass over the program is more efficient than
 two.
For the theory, however, it is better to keep surface typing separate
 from a @emph{completion}@~cite{h-scp-1994}
 pass that inserts @|stransient| checks 

In the model of @|sShallow| Racket, completion is a judgment (@${\compilesto})
 that transforms a well-typed surface term to a term with @|stransient| checks.
The goal is to insert enough checks to create a target-language term with
 a similar type.

@exact|{
\theoremsketch{completion correctness}{
  If\/ ${\sWT \sexpr_0 : \stype_0}$
  then\/ ${\sWT \sexpr_0 : \stype_0 \compilesto \sexpr_1}$
  and\/ ${\sWTtag \sexpr_1 : \tagof{\stype_0}}$.
}
}|

The first benefit of this theorem is that it rules out nonsensical completions.
By contrast, a type elaboration that converts all surface terms to the
 integer @${42} satisfies every theorem used to validate the original
 @|stransient|@~cite{vss-popl-2017}.

Second, the clear requirement makes it easier to adapt the idea of @|stransient|
 to a new language.
If the language has its own surface-level typing and type-to-shape metafunction
 (@${\tagof{\cdot}}), then completion correctness theorem guides the next steps.

Third, the specification motivates refined completions and target-level typings.
The challenge is to use as few checks as possible to build the target term.
For example, suppose the variable @codett{xy} points to a pair of numbers
 and consider the expression @codett{(+ (car xy) (car xy))}.
The completion for @|sShallow| Racket produces the following term:

@code-nested{(+ (check Num (car xy)) (check Num (car xy)))}

@|noindent|Racket guarantees left-to-right evaluation, however, so the second check
 can never fail.
An improved completion would eliminate this, and other, flow-dominated checks.

@futurework{
  Adapt Typed Racket's occurrence typing to support a completion pass that
   avoids dominated checks.
  Evaluate the performance improvement.

@section[#:tag "sec:transient:implementation"]{Implementation}

Overview, figure of compiler pipeline, re-use.

Key aspects below:
 creating shapes,
 inserting shapes,
 optimizing accordingly.
Plus two miscellaneous sections.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:transient:types"]{From Types to Shapes}

@|sShallow| Racket compiles static types to @emph{type shape} checks.
Each check enforces first-order properties of a type constructor.
In general, a successful check means that all well-typed operations
 should succeed at run-time.

For example, the type @codett{(Pairof String String)} uses the @codett{Pairof}
 type constructor; its shape check, @codett{pair?}, accepts any kind of
 pair.
A successful check @codett{(pair? v)} means that the operations
 @codett{(car v)} and @codett{(cdr v)} are well-defined, and nothing more.
Because these two operations are the only elimination forms for the
 @codett{Pairof} constructor, the shape meets its goal.

Types that support many first-order properties have more complex shape checks.
For example, an object comes with field and method names.
The shape check must ensure that type-correct calls to @codett{get-field}
 and @codett{send} succeed at run-time.

Below are several more example types, chosen to illustrate the variety
 and challenges of extending @|stransient|.
Each type comes with a high-level shape that illustrates the implementation
 and a brief discussion.

@itemlist[
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Listof Real)"
    #:shape "list?"
    #:cost "O(v)"
  ]

  The type represents lists of real numbers.
  The shape accepts any proper list;
   an improper list like @codett{(cons 1 (cons 2 3))} is not allowed.
  The run-time cost depends on the size of input values;
   that being said, pairs are immutable and the predicate @codett{list?} caches
   its results.
  The optimizer uses the shape to rewrite getters.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(List Real Real)"
    #:shape "(and/c list? (λ(v) (= 2 (length l))))"
    #:cost "O(v)"
  ]

  Represents a list with exactly two numbers.
  The shape checks lengths.
  Doing so lets the optimizer change @codett{(list-ref v 1)}
   to @codett{(unsafe-list-ref v 1)}.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Rec Chain (U Null (Pairof Chain Real)))"
    #:shape "(or/c null? pair?)"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  The recursive type is isomorphic to @codett{(Listof Real)}, but enforced
   with a more primitive check.
  In general, built-in lists have the only shape whose cost depends on input
   values.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Vector Real)"
    #:shape "(and/c vector? (λ(v) (= 1 (vector-length v))))"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a vector that contains exactly one number.
  The shape checks length; the optimizer uses this fact.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Mutable-Vectorof Real)"
    #:shape "(and/c vector? (not/c immutable?))"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a mutable vector with any number of elements.
  Vectors can also be immutable; the parent type @codett{Vector} covers both.
  The optimizer does not look at mutability, but the type checker does
   to raise static type errors.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Weak-HashTable Symbol (-> Void))"
    #:shape "(and/c hash? hash-weak?)"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a mutable hash table whose keys do not inhibit the garbage collector.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(U Real String)"
    #:shape "(or/c real? string?)"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Untagged union.
  The shape accepts either a real number or a string.
  Wider unions, with @${N} types inside, have shapes with @${N} components.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Syntaxof String)"
    #:shape "syntax?"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a syntax object that contains a string.
  The shape checks for a syntax object.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Syntaxof Symbol)"
    #:shape "identifier?"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a syntax object that contains a symbol; that is, an identifier.
  The shape check goes deeper and confirms the symbol.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "Integer"
    #:shape "exact-integer?"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a mathematical integer.
  The shape checks for exactness; an inexact integer such as @codett{4.0} is
   not allowed.

  Other numeric types require larger checks for additional properties,
   for example @codett{Negative-Integer} adds looks for an exact integer that
   is less than zero.

  To the type system, numeric types are wide unions.
  Shape enforcement flattens unions wherever possible.
  Contract enforcement does likewise.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Refine [n : Integer] (= n 42))"
    #:shape "(and/c exact-integer? (=/c 42))"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents an integer that is equal to @codett{42}.

  Refinement types attach a predicate to a static type.
  Predicates are limited to a linear arithmetic.
  The shape check uses the whole predicate.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(Class (field [a Natural]) (get-a (-> Natural)))"
    #:shape "(contract-first-order (class/c (field a) get-a))"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a class with one field and one method.
  The shape depends on the @codett{racket/contract} library to check simple
   properties of class shape.
  Object types have similar checks, using @codett{object/c} instead.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(-> Real String)"
    #:shape "(arity-includes/c 1)"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a function with one mandatory argument.
  The shape checks arity.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(-> Real * Real)"
    #:shape "(arity-includes/c 0)"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents a function that accepts any number of positional arguments.
  The shape looks for functions that can accept zero arguments,
   but does not check whether they accept more.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(case-> (-> Symbol Symbol) (-> Symbol Real Symbol))"
    #:shape "(and/c (arity-includes/c 1) (arity-includes/c 2))"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  Represents an overloaded function.
  The shape checks both arities.

  Functions can also have optional, keyword, and optional keyword arguments.
  The shapes for such functions check that the keywords are accepted.
}
@item{
  @example-type-shape[
    #:type "(All (A) A)"
    #:shape "any/c"
    #:cost "O(1)"]

  TODO is this correct? Maybe names should be none/c, does that break things?
  Well (All (A) (Pairof A A)) would be nontrivial but equally bad to inhabit.
  And (All (A) (-> A A)) is supposed to work with anything.
}
]

@futurework{
  The Typed Racket optimizer does not take advantage of all shapes.
  In this sense, the check for functions is an unnecessary cost---even
   @codett{procedure?} would be a waste, because the TR optimizer does
   not use it.
  Improve the optimizer where possible and remove other shape checks.
  How do the changes impact performance?
  Try writing a few programs;
   perhaps by converting Reticulated benchmarks to @|sShallow| Racket.
  Do the removed shape checks make programs more difficult to debug?
