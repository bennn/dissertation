@title[#:tag "sec:design:strategies"]{Overview of Type-Enforcement Strategies}
@latex-label{sec:design:strategies}

CALLED OFF

@;To validate the expressiveness of the framework, this section models six semantics from the literature.
@;Three semantics have been implemented for full-fledged languages:
@; @|nname|, @|tname|, and @|ename| (@sectionref{sec:design:jungle}).
@;One, @|aname|, explores a theoretical tradeoff to improve the blame guarantees of the
@; @|tname| semantics.
@;The remaining two, @|cname| and @|fname|, originate in prior work@~citep{g-popl-2015,gf-icfp-2018}
@; and explore the gap between the @|nname| and @|tname| strategies.
@;
@;This section presents an informal overview of the type-enforcement strategies;
@; all technical definitions and properties appear in @sectionref{sec:design:technical}.
@;The discussion begins with the semantics that is lowest on the error
@; preorder (@|nname|) and ascends (@|ename|):
@;
@;@itemlist[
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\nname{}}}
@;   : Wrap higher-order values; eagerly validate first-order values.
@;  }
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\cname{}}}
@;  : Wrap higher-order and first-order values.
@;  }
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\fname{}}}
@;  : Wrap higher-order and first-order values, but drop inner wrappers.
@;  }
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\tname{}}}
@;  : Check the shape of all values that appear in typed code.
@;  }
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\aname{}}}
@;  : Check shapes like @|tname|; use wrappers to remember boundaries.
@;  }
@;  @item{@exact{\textstrat{\ename{}}}
@;  : Check nothing. Do not enforce static types at runtime.
@;  }]
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:natural"]{@|nname|}
@;
@;@|nname| strictly enforces the boundaries between typed and untyped code.
@;Every time a typed context imports an untyped value,
@; the value receives a comprehensive check.
@;For first-order data, the full check implies a deep traversal of the incoming
@; value.
@;For higher-order data, a full check at the time of crossing the boundary is
@; impossible; instead, @|nname| wraps the incoming value to monitor its future behavior.
@;
@;More formally, when an untyped value @${\svalue} flows into a context
@; that expects some value of type @${\stype},
@; @|nname| employs the type-directed validation strategy in the left column
@; below.
@;The strategy on the right protects a typed value from an untyped 
@; context:
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\nname{}}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is an integer
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a tuple and recursively validate its elements
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a function and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   protect higher-order inputs and validate outputs
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  recursively protect elements
@;  \\
@;}{
@;  wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   validate inputs and protect higher-order outputs
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;@subsection[#:tag "sec:design:strat:performance"]{Theoretical Costs, Motivation for Alternative Methods}
@;
@;Implementations of the @|nname| approach have struggled with the performance
@; overhead of enforcing types@~citep{ff-icfp-2002,gtnffvf-jfp-2019}
@; and have inspired semantics with tighter time and space
@; bounds@~citep{htf-hosc-2010,stw-pldi-2015,g-popl-2015,bbst-oopsla-2017,fgsfs-oopsla-2018,kas-pldi-2019}.
@;A glance at the sketch above suggests three sources for this overhead:
@; @emph{checking} that a value matches a type,
@; the layer of @emph{indirection} that a wrapper adds,
@; and the @emph{allocation} cost.
@;
@;For base types and higher-order types, the cost of checking is presumably low.
@;Testing whether a value is an integer or a function is a cheap operation in
@; languages that support dynamic typing.
@;Pairs, however, illustrate the potential for serious overhead.
@;When a deeply-nested pair value reaches a boundary, @|nname| follows the type
@; to conduct an eager and comprehensive check.
@;The cost of a successful check is linear in the size of the type.
@;In a language with recursive types---perhaps for lists---the
@; cost is linear in the size of the incoming value.
@;
@;The indirection cost grows in proportion to the number of wrappers on a value.
@;There is no limit to the number of wrappers in @|nname|,
@; so this cost can grow without bound.
@;Indeed, the combined cost of checking and indirection can lead to
@; exponential slowdown even in simple programs@~citep{htf-hosc-2010,g-popl-2015,tfdfftf-ecoop-2015,fgsfs-oopsla-2018,kas-pldi-2019}.
@;
@;Lastly, creating a wrapper initializes a data structure.
@;Creating an unbounded number of wrappers incurs a proportional cost,
@; which may add up to a significant fraction of a program's running time.
@;
@;These theoretical costs motivate the next three strategies.
@;First, the @|cname| strategy (@sectionref{sec:design:strat:conatural}) reduces the
@; up-front cost of checks via additional wrappers.
@;Second, the @|fname| strategy (@sectionref{sec:design:strat:forgetful}) reduces indirection
@; by keeping at most two wrappers on any value and discarding the rest.
@;Third, the @|tname| strategy (@sectionref{sec:design:strat:transient})
@; removes wrappers altogether by enforcing a weaker invariant.
@;
@;
@;@; TODO smaller list item sep
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|nname|}}
@;
@;The name ``@|nname|'' comes from @citet{mf-toplas-2009}, who use it
@; to describe a proxy method for transporting untyped functions into a
@; typed context.
@;Prior works on higher-order contracts@~citep{ff-icfp-2002},
@; remote procedure calls@~citep{ok-popl-2003}, and
@; typed foreign function interfaces@~citep{r-jfp-2008}
@; employ a similar method.
@;In the gradual typing literature, this method is also
@; called ``guarded''@~citep{vksb-dls-2014}, ``behavioral''@~citep{clzv-ecoop-2018},
@; and ``deep''@~citep{tgpk-dls-2018}.
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:conatural"]{@|cname|}
@;
@;The @|cname| method checks only the shape of values at a boundary.
@;Instead of eagerly validating the contents of a data structure,
@; @|cname| creates a wrapper to perform validation by need.
@;The cost of checking at a boundary is thereby reduced to the worst-case cost
@; of a shape check.
@;Allocation and indirection costs may increase, however, because first-order
@; values now receive wrappers.
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\cname{}}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is an integer
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a tuple and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   validate projections
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a function and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   protect higher-order inputs and validate outputs
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   protect future projections
@;   \\
@;}{
@;  wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   validate inputs and protect higher-order outputs
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|cname|}}
@;
@;The @|cname| strategy introduces a small amount of laziness.
@;By contrast to @|nname|, which eagerly validates immutable data structures,
@; @|cname| waits until an elimination form.
@;The choice is analogous to the question of initial algebra vs. final algebra
@; semantics for such datatypes@~citep{w-jcss-1979,c-lfp-1980,bt-siam-1983},
@; hence the prefix ``Co'' is a reminder that
@; some checks now happen at an opposite time.
@;@citet{fgr-ifl-2007} implement exactly the @|cname| strategy for Racket struct contracts.
@;Other researchers have explored variations on lazy contracts@~citep{hjl-flops-2006,df-toplas-2011,c-icfp-2012,dtw-pepm-2012};
@; for instance, by delaying even shape checks until a computation depends on the value.
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:forgetful"]{@|fname|}
@;
@;The goal of @|fname| is to limit the number of wrappers around
@; a value.
@;A key non-goal is to enforce types as compositionally-valid claims about code.
@;Typed code can rely on the static types that it declares, but nothing more.
@;Untyped code cannot trust type annotations because those
@; types might never be checked.
@;
@;The @|fname| strategy is to keep at most two wrappers around a value.
@;An untyped value gets one wrapper when it enters a typed
@; context and loses this wrapper upon exit.
@;A typed value gets a ``sticky'' inner wrapper the first time
@; it exits typed code and gains a ``temporary'' outer wrapper whenever
@; it re-enters a typed context.
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\fname{}}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is an integer
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a tuple and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   validate projections
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a function and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   protect higher-order inputs and validate outputs
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  if $\svalue$ has a wrapper, discard it;
@;   otherwise wrap $\svalue$ to protect projections
@;}{
@;  if $\svalue$ has a wrapper, discard it;
@;   otherwise wrap $\svalue$ to validate inputs and protect higher-order outputs
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|fname|}}
@;
@;@citet{g-popl-2015} introduces forgetful manifest contracts and proves
@; type soundness; the extended version of the paper contains a detailed
@; discussion, including the observation that forgetful types cannot support
@; abstraction and information hiding (@shorturl["https://" "arxiv.org/abs/1410.2813"]).
@;@citet{cl-icfp-2017} present a forgetful and type sound semantics for a
@; mixed-typed language.
@;
@;By contrast to @|fname|, there are other strategies that limit the number of
@; wrappers on a value without sacficing type guarantees@~citep{htf-hosc-2010,g-popl-2015,stw-pldi-2015}.
@;These methods require a protocol for merging wrappers, whereas
@; @|fname| is a simple and type-sound way to save time and space.
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:transient"]{@|tname|}
@;
@;The @|tname| method ensures that typed code
@; does not ``go wrong'' in the sense of applying a
@; primitive operation to a value outside its domain.
@;Every application @${(\sexpr_0~\sexpr_1)} in typed code can, for example,
@; trust that the value of @${\sexpr_0} is a function.
@;
@;@|tname| meets this goal without the use of wrappers or deep checks.
@;Instead, it rewrites typed code to pre-emptively check the shape of values.
@;Every type boundary, every typed elimination form, and every typed
@; function gets protected with a shape check;
@; these checks validate the output of boundaries and elimination forms,
@; and the input to typed functions.
@;
@;As the name suggests, a shape check matches the top-level constructor of a
@; value against the top-level constructor of a type.
@;The following table describes the checks that happen at a boundary;
@; the extra checks in typed code perform dynamic-to-static checks.
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\tname{}}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is an integer
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a pair
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a function
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;  %% (typed functions must validate all inputs with a shape check)
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;A more expressive language of types, however, may require deeper shape checks.
@;For instance, a union-type check must consider each alternative in the union.
@;@citet{gf-icfp-2018} supply additional comments and performance data regarding an
@; implementation of @|tname| for the Typed Racket surface language.
@;
@;In general, @|tname| checks add up to a greater number of run-time validation
@; points than those that arise in a wrapper-based semantics, but their overall cost may be
@; lower and more predictable.
@;Static analysis can reduce the number of checks@~citep{vsc-dls-2019}.
@;
@;
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|tname|}}
@;
@;@citet{v-thesis-2019} invented @|tname| for Reticulated Python.
@;The name suggests the nature of its run-time checks; transient type-enforcement
@; enforces local assumptions in typed code, but has no long-lasting ability
@; to influence untyped behaviors@~citep{vksb-dls-2014}.
@;@|tname| has been adapted to Typed Racket@~citep{gf-icfp-2018}
@; and has inspired a closely-related approach for Grace@~citep{rmhn-ecoop-2019}.
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:amnesic"]{@|aname|}
@;
@;The goal of the @|aname| semantics is to provide the same behavior as
@; @|tname| but improve the error messages when a type mismatch occurs.
@;@|aname| demonstrates that wrappers offer more than a way to detect errors;
@; they seem essential for informative errors.
@;
@;The @|aname| strategy consists of three steps:
@; it wraps values,
@; it discards all but three wrappers,
@; and it keeps a record of discarded boundary specifications.
@;When a type mismatch occurs, @|aname| presents the recorded boundaries
@; to the programmer.
@;
@;@|aname| employs both guard wrappers and @emph{trace} wrappers.
@;In the model, a trace wrapper records
@; a list of boundaries that a value has previously crossed.
@;If an untyped function enters a typed component, @|aname| wraps the
@; function in a guard.
@;If the function travels back to untyped code, @|aname| replaces the
@; guard with a trace wrapper that records two boundaries.
@;Future round-trips extend the trace.
@;Conversely, a typed function that flows to untyped code and back @${N{+}1} times gets
@; three wrappers: an outer guard to protect its
@; current typed client, a middle trace to record its last @${N} trips, and an
@; inner guard to protect its body.
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\aname{}}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is an integer
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a tuple and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   check projections
@;}{
@;  check that $\svalue$ is a function and wrap $\svalue$ to
@;   protect higher-order inputs and validate outputs
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  if $\svalue$ has a guard wrapper, replace with a trace;
@;   otherwise guard $\svalue$
@;}{
@;  if $\svalue$ has a guard wrapper, replace with a trace;
@;   otherwise guard $\svalue$
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|aname|}}
@;
@;@|aname| is a synthesis of @|fname| and @|tname| that
@; demonstrates how our framework can guide the design of new checking strategies@~citep{gfd-oopsla-2019}.
@;The name suggests a connection to forgetful, and the Greek influence of
@; one collaborator.
@;
@;
@;@section[#:tag "sec:design:strat:erasure"]{@|ename|}
@;
@;The @|ename| approach is based on a view of types as an optional syntactic artifact.
@;Type annotations are a structured form of comment that help developers and
@; tools read a codebase.
@;At runtime, types are meaningless.
@;Any value may flow into any context:
@;
@;@exact|{
@;\formatapproach{\ename{}}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}{
@;  check nothing
@;}
@;}|
@;
@;Despite the complete lack of type enforcement, the @|ename| strategy is
@; widely used (@figureref{fig:landscape}) and has a number of pragmatic benefits.
@;The static type checker can point out logical errors in type-annotated code.
@;An IDE may use the static types in auto-completion and refactoring tools.
@;An implementation does not require any instrumentation to enforce types.
@;Users that are familiar with the host language do not need to learn
@; a new semantics to understand the behavior of type-annotated programs.
@;Finally, @|ename| runs equally fast as a host-language program.
@;
@;
@;@subsection{@forigins{@|ename|}}
@;
@;@|ename| is also known as @emph{optional typing} and dates back to the type hints
@; of MACLISP@~citep{m-maclisp-1974} and Common Lisp@~citep{s-lisp-1990}.
@;StrongTalk is another early and influential optionally-typed language@~citep{bg-oopsla-1993}.
@;Models of optional typing exist for JavaScript@~citep{bat-ecoop-2014,cvgrl-oopsla-2017},
@; Lua@~citep{mmi-dls-2015},
@; and Clojure@~citep{bdt-esop-2016}.
