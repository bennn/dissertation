@title{Why Migratory Typing}

This dissertation contributes to the world of mixed-typed languages.
Any programming language that combines statically-typed and dynamically-typed
 code can benefit from the results below.
My motivation, however, is the vision of migratory typing---one
 particular way of mixing typed and untyped code.

Since migratory typing is the motivation behind my work,
 @section-ref{sec:mt} introduces and motivates migratory typing.
The discussion is based on @~a[num-mt-principle] defining principles.

For context, @section-ref{sec:non-mt} surveys other ways of making mixed-typed
 programs.
Each has something in common with migratory typing;
 they almost all satisfy basic principles motivating typed/untyped mixtures.
But they fail one or the other MT principle.


@section[#:tag "sec:mt"]{Why Migratory Typing}

@define-mt-principle['new-tool-for-new-code]{Enable Improvements}

Types are a useful technology.
Want the option of using types.


@define-mt-principle['no-catchall]{Flexibility via Subtyping}

Type system must have subtyping to give choice of precision.

Nothing more, no dynamic type for flexibility because plausibility check
makes types too weak.


@define-mt-principle['clear-boundary]{Clear Boundaries}

Because untyped code exists, miscommunications are possible.
Need to trace back to typed/untyped interfaces.
These interfaces need to be clear in the source code for meaningful errors.
Such errors are critical, analogy to static type errors.

@section[#:tag "sec:non-mt"]{Other Mixed-Typed Methods}

There are several other methods, besides migratory typing, for mixing typed
and untyped code.
Here we review the main ones.


@subsection{Gradual Typing}

Gradual typing includes a special dynamic type.
Satisfies guarantees.

PS No guarantee that untyped code exists, maybe cannot reuse.

Pros: easy to use

Cons: catch-all type hides errors, inhibits blame 

Conjecture reading vs writing tradeoff


@subsection{Dart 2}

New top type, accepts any method call.

Cons: untyped code does not exist, no reuse


@subsection{Soft Typing}

Infer types for any untyped program.

Cons: does not reject, no explicit annotations


@subsection{Lump Type-Dynamic}

Special type, embedding / projection.

Cons: rewrite code when adding types, classic con of memorize proj-path ... this
one is really more related work


@subsection{Quasi-Static Typing}

Generalize GT?

Cons: lack boundaries,

very related work, point out the design alternatives from Thatte
