- [X] intro : assumptions about gradual / migratory typing,
  see jfp19=X oopsla19=? jfp20=? proposal=X
  - [X] hang on, assumptions must go in extra chapter,
        they're not critical for theory work,
        they only set stage for performance ---- again not critical,
        it's just a gradual essay for why we picked this
        chapter2 = why
        chapter1 = what it's all about
        ... maybe DO want that TS Eliot quote to explain the writing experiment
- [X] performance chapter (2), adapt jfp19
- [X] theory chapter (3)
  ... copy JFP, get building, thats all for now
- [X] transient-racket chapter (4)
  - [X] committee update email
  - [X] TR RFC
  - [X] 2020-07-22 : share chap4 outline, diff with first attempt, intro, committee update
  - [X] blame section
  - [X] blame table
  - [X] future work
- [X] full intro (1)
- [X] "both" chapter
- [X] related
- [X] conclusion ... other chapters?
- [X] HEY write the contributions, separate from thesis
      the CONTRIBUTIONS will survive need to applaud them
- [X] "methods" -> "method" goddammit I am the first with these great METHOD canonical,
      you can improve but you will be second (abstract intro conclusion)
- [X] diss to committee
- [X] GTP case study needs work
- [X] sk > I know it's fashionable to say such things at NU, but I'm not sure I agree that "a compiler cannot use optional types to justify transformations".  It certainly can: it just needs to then generate code that guards against using the transformed code.  It's a bit like saying "a JIT cannot use run-time values to justify specializations" â€” yet that's exactly what a JIT does every day?
- [X] sk PR talk sounds like shallow replacing TR
- [X] jv fig 58 be clear this is fully-typed, explain why; same for all "ratios" tables
- [X] jv fig65 what is timeout and is it worse than deep? explain
- [-] jv try to be clearer that end is shallow without blame ... in figures?
      no, it's fine, future work makes it clear
- [X] jv ack Like types with the Concrete / Erasure switch
- [-] jv isn't this a challenge to explain two behaviors and modes to programmers (yes, we haven't even explained the first!)
- [X] jv what can Shallow do to approximate blame? (keep 1st only, use srcloc instead of id)
- [-] jv remark that Shallow\blame is mitigated by running Deep
- [X] fh typo TS def, chapter 6, mixing lang L with type X
- [ ] st benchmarks, new threat, some benchmarks have boundaries that we wrote to contextual modules!!
         alts = consider this as partial lattice with ctx attached (is current really the same??!)
                use unsafe boundary for context
                port entire library
- [ ] st benchmarks, threat, data / structs all in one file
      arose from snake,tetris,zombie arose because of SCV limitations
      what could results be in a ... synth2 ... without the wall
- [ ] st sampling, try the worst-case bounds ... what if picked (N slowest) (N fastest) (N slow, N fast)
      ... what are the odds for that?
- [ ] st fig 48 unclear, use new example, the point is only check at elim forms and
      upcast changes the elim forms
      lazy-fact is bad because it upcasts the result instead of the value
- [ ] st p49 wrappers also cause identity problems, the trouble is not only cost and correctness
- [ ] st sec 2 whats the idea here, what inference systems in bounds?
      be clear the goal (stepping stones) ... why else discuss set-based analysis
- [ ] st more lisp .... SPCL does typechecking for -> too, but undocumented
      Typed Lisp, by Cartwright 1976 ... copy Sam's dissertation for comments
- [ ] st StrongTalk unrelated to lisp, don't remove their history credit
      also they'll use types to optimize when safe
      Hack, similar, has given up
- [ ] st remove Pycket from languages picture, it's not a PL, ditto for JFP
- [ ] st double-check Strongscript TS* SafeTS for gradual/migratory
- [ ] st double-check ActionScript too, add a version number
- [ ] st add Sorbet to figure, gotta check the implementation for parts
- [ ] st Monotonic is implemented in Grift and probably TS*
- [ ] st Castagna close to Natural, acknowledge it, same for forgetful ... at this point in the paper they're alike
- [ ] st fig 25 does not blame net/url blames interface! double check, get it right
- [ ] st fig 26 be clear its the same error as no types whatsoever
- [ ] st canonical forms ... mention in sec 4.3 supports optimization
         put lemmas into 4.6.X ... what do they look like? ditto JFP
- [ ] st fig5 colors, descriptions are wrong so pick new colors anyway
- [ ] st snake and tetris are both educational and game
- [ ] cd fig 46 unclear why checks must be there ... add example?
      also perhaps discuss casts vs checks
- [ ] cd "nearby" clarify 'cannot describe designs'
- [-] fh review mcallester, kaist, rehof ... think semantic again

- [ ] blame-trail: matthias asked for a handmade bug in acquire that goes 6-7 hops away



- [ ] push MF edits up to JFP

Style
- [ ] goddammit typed-color too dark in oopsla-2019/pict
- [X] chapter or section for references? no
- [ ] fig 62+, bad titles for deep vs shallow exact plots
- [ ] shallow/CACHE too big, why are files so huge?
      could zip them
- [ ] hyperlinks broken because scribble labels
- [ ] paragraph style looks bad with subsections
- [ ] why not scribble/text ???
- [ ] color-code ideas:
  - sec 2 typed=black, untyped=white
  - sec 3 typed=grey, untyped=white ... moving beyond black/white but not sure yet
  - beyond : multi-color for typed components, depends on semantics
  - apply to figures in BOTH chapter
- [ ] print "x" after overheads
- [X] too many exercises, looks like everything has holes, save those for end
- [X] freeze body for exact plots ,,, also they are too wide! reduce max-width by 1 or 2?
- [X] careful about common lisp characterization ... free to ignore, opt non-mand
- [X] start every chapter with acks, papers, people
- [ ] MF has boxes around hyperlinks why
- [ ] soft typing, remove bullet points
- [X] 2.2.2 still awkward
- [ ] 2.2.3 very awkward ... when do I have time to fix?!
- [ ] add x to all overheads?

MF edits, leftover
- [ ] (p3) 1 compare sim / dif. in the "two properties" paragraph ... make it stronger
- [ ] (p13) 3 novel configurations in between
- [ ] (p14) 3 experience with TR section
- [X] (p45) 3 cache?
- [ ] (p53) 4 think about solid vs dashed arrows
- [ ] (p54) 4 specify error, in fig?
- [X] (p63) 4 how to add dynamic type, orthogonal
- [ ] (p64) 4 fix codeblock colors, use "a --" style with label on left at least
- [ ] bring Deep and Shallow into chap 4
- [ ] (p111) 4 conclusion, wrappers vs lambda
- [ ] (p117) 5 move note to end? perf
- [ ] (p119) 5 insert theorem completion correctness ... and a few others
- [X] (p120) 5 better road map .... move integrate blame/Perf explanation
- [X] (p124) 5 how many actions?
- [ ] (p125) 5 correctness, careful
- [X] (p125) 5 Along the way
- [ ] (p129) 5 function clones ... N entry points
- [ ] (p130) 5 "protecting functions ..." gone, is it graceful?
- [X] Q (p132) 5 remove bonus fixes?
- [ ] Q (p148) 6 "not readable" ?
- [X] (p150) 6 redex model
- [ ] (p156) 6 matrix, not rules
- [X] (p157) 6 labeled semantics ... but comes about in CM proof YES really need the labeled semantics
- [X] (p161) 6 labeled red, what symbol?
- [X] (p163) 6 lemmas, explain where needed
- [ ] (p167) 6 why can shallow be aware of deep? articulate benefits
- [ ] 4 move error preorder to bottom row in table 2 --- just like table 1

#### dear diary

2020-06-18 : need to get moving, spend 2 hours/day or more cmon now
2020-07-09 : we are rolling now, but still way slow progress/hour is pitiful
2020-07-20 : performance and design chapters are imported, need to get serious about transient / data
2020-08-06 : transient data is coming in ... all bugs fixed?
2020-08-12 : transient, waiting on quad, some untypeds way too slow (fsm*)

#### oddball future work

(Q = wrote up as `futurework` question)

- [Q] graduality => errors theorem (icfp 18)
- [Q] natural is a nat. trans.

#### outlines

2020-02-03 :
 Matthias says, the two journal papers will be approx. two chapters so we can
 work those in whenever ready.

2020-05-22 :
 outline attempt
  (why not chronological?)

 0. honest + lying can coexist, thesis ... quest for practical GT
 1. different semantics, which is best? lacking theory + eval landscape
 2. perf eval, applied to TR + Retic (ignore ICFP)
 3. theory eval, for Guarded + Transient + Erasure + compromises
 4. Guarded + Transient
    - why this pair
    - model
    - evaluation
    - other benefits
 5. threats, other concerns (survey)
 6. related work
 7. 

Ben's dissertation outline (2020-05-29):

1. intro, up to thesis,
   contributions that led to thesis
   - perf. evaluation method
     sampling,
     apply to TR, Retic
   - theory analysis
     compromise semantics (TS not enough)
     CM distinguishes honest vs lying
     blame soundness + completeness
   - transient racket (without TR)
     generalize to richer type system (unions, subtyping, ...)
     remove type dynamic
     ... generalize what's needed to insert check?
   - integrating transient + TR
     generalizes smoothly, no surprises
   [[ chapter outline:
      begin with thesis statement (<=1.5 pages),
      short intro to GT, assumptions (migratory vs "gradual"),
      contributions that led to thesis, see above, co-influences,
      chapters outline ]]
2. performance analysis method (goal: fair relative perf, ....)
   - systematic, data collection
     - sampling,
   - visualization
   - apply to TR & retic, validate method
     - suggestion: order of mag. difference, intrinsic!, different shape/curve
     - question: can port transient to racket & reproduce?
3. design analysis method
   - thesis: use standard theory + some new theory to organize design space,
   - tools:
     - parameterized TS
     - complete monitoring
     - blame S + C
   - apply to TR, Retic, Amnesic, Erasure, ....
4. transient racket, implementation (transient + untyped Racket, that's all, can be standalone paper)
   (inherit types + checker from TR but nothing more)
   scale transient to real language, richer type system, 10x gone,
   - theory generalization, to racket types
   - eng. adaptation, to racket lang
   - perf. properties
   - blame, more accessors + manipulators, compromises, huge allocation,
     circularity type at runtime
5. natural + transient + untyped
   (meaning: what are we giving to programmers)
   - simple model
     - no worries, properties still hold
     - failed attempts at natural/transient cooperation to reduce checks,
       possible futures (forgetful)
   - expressiveness
     - (Syntaxof (-> Int Int)) ... new mixed programs that TR doesn't allow
   - implementation
     - require/untyped-contract
     - define-typed/untyped-id
     - ....
   - evaluation
     - ?? 2-way lattice? 3-way
     - ?? programs where mix is better than natural-only or transient-only
     - threats: no blame in transient, 
6. related work soup
   chap 2 - evaluation method
   chap 3 - GTT, KafKa, gradual guarantee?, other analysis
   chap 4 - other impls of transient
   chap 5 - (new)
7. new questions
  - transient + JIT, really fast!? on Pycket, apples-to-apples AOT Racket vs JIT
  - static analysis for transient checks, minimize ala Henglein?
  - transient + blame, practical alternative?
  - need wrappers? forgetful/amnesic instead of transient
8. conclusion
  - summarize chapters, what did
  - revisited fundamental questions (TS, what do types mean at runtime)
