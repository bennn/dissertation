Hello committee members,

Today I shipped a first-draft dissertation to Matthias. We expect to have a
copy to you by November 1. My goal is to defend during the first half of
December.

Please let me know if you have any large/complex time constraints in Nov. / Dec.

The dissertation currently has eight chapters and 198 pages. Here is a brief summary:

Title = Deep and Shallow Types

  1. Introduction, thesis statement
  2. Background on gradual typing & my approach in particular
  3. How to evaluate the performance of gradual types
  4. How to evaluate the semantics of gradual types
  5. Shallow types for Racket: design, implementation, and challenges
  6. Deep and Shallow together: model, implementation, and analysis
  7. Future work
  8. Conclusions

Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the technical ones. Chapter 3 combines my past works
on measuring performance --- both for Typed Racket and Reticulated. Chapter 4
is based on a journal article that we* submitted this year to the JFP special
issue on gradual typing. Chapters 5 and 6 are all new material.

* we = Ben, Matthias, and Christos Dimoulas

Thanks,
Ben

Dear committee members,

Since the last update, I have:

- collected some data on the transient implementation;
- tried adding blame, found the POPL'17 algorithm unusably slow;
- and started piecing together the dissertation


## transient performance

Transient is often better than normal Typed Racket, but not always.

The table here shows worst-case overheads in a few small benchmarks.
Transient wins by a lot in `jpeg` and `zombie`, but fares worse in three.
`snake` is especially bad.

| benchmark  |  max TR |  max transient | %dif |
|------------+---------+----------------+------|
| suffixtree |  15.56x |         15.34x | 0.99 |
| fsm        |   1.25x |          1.06x | 0.85 |
| jpeg       |  19.98x |          2.04x | 0.10 |
| kcfa       |   3.81x |          3.78x | 0.99 |
| mbta       |   1.43x |          1.41x | 0.98 |
| morsecode  |   1.84x |          2.48x | 1.35 |
| snake      |  15.19x |         22.13x | 1.46 |
| zombie     |  53.95x |          3.39x | 0.06 |
| zordoz     |   2.77x |          5.74x | 2.07 |

What to do?
In the past, my Transient would remove the runtime check around `(f x)` if `f`
was defined in transient code and never crossed a boundary. This helped bring
`snake` to a ~8x overhead, but isn't safe in general.


## blame

I tried implementing the blame algorithm from Vitousek et al POPL 2017.

The algorithm idea is to keep a map from functions/pairs/objects to boundary
types. When one value gets eliminated, this map gets a new entry pointing
from the result to its parent's boundary types.

Keeping this map up-to-date, however, takes a LOT of extra time and space
at runtime. Here are a few rows from above with a new column for a
preliminary transient with blame:

| benchmark |  max TR |  max transient | transient-blame |
|-----------+---------+----------------+-----------------|
| jpeg      |  19.98x |          2.04x |           4.79x |
| snake     |  15.19x |         22.13x |         224.27x |
| zordoz    |   2.77x |          5.74x |          10.81x |

Besides the huge cost, there are other challenges that I will explain in
the dissertation. Transient blame seems impractical.


## dissertation

I have been importing material from past work---mostly JFP 19 and our submission
to the JFP special issue on gradual typing---into the dissertation. Right now,
I have first drafts for 3 of the 8 planned chapters.


## public pre-release of transient

The goal for Transient is to merge into a future Typed Racket release. Things
are coming along, so I've opened a pull request with the main part of the
implementation to solicit comments:

  <https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/948>




update 2020-02-21

Dear committee members,

Since last time, I've stopped work on the model and switched focus to
an implementation of Transient Typed Racket.


## revised thesis statement

Honest and lying types can coexist in a way that preserves their formal
properties; programmers can combine these types to strengthen lying-type
guarantees, avoid unimportant honest-type runtime errors, and lower the
running time of typed/untyped interactions.


## model

In January / February, I worked to reduce the number of run-time checks
that the previous model required. This work has been unsuccessful in general;
see the bottom of this message for details.

I've decided to stick with the model from last time and base the
implementation on that.


## implementation

I've been making progress fixing bugs and getting benchmarks to run with a
Transient Typed Racket. Right now all of the benchmarks can run, but I need to
do more testing to make sure they're running correctly and efficiently.

Here is a patch that shows the changes to base Typed Racket:

  https://gist.github.com/bennn/e2971f65448adaa5831288d585861f43


## next

For next time, the goal is to report some lessons and measurements about the
implementation.

## extra notes on the model

We currently have a model that combines honest & lying types in a simple way.
If we split a program into 3 worlds --- H = honest, L = lying, U = untyped ---
then the diagram below shows the checks that currently happen at every boundary.
A "wrap" is a wrapper or deep check, a "scan" is a shape check, and a "noop"
is no check.

      +--[wrap]-->  H  <--[wrap]--+
      |                           |
      v                           v
         >-------[noop]-------->
      L                           U
         <-------[scan]--------<

     Current status

The question from last update was whether we can get away with fewer wraps
and scans by adding labels to every boundary. For example, a `wrap` boundary
could turn into `wrap(from H to L)`.

If lying types = transient, then the answer is usually no. For special cases
we can avoid wrapping an L value that enters an H context, but in general
boundary labels aren't enough. So the picture above doesn't change. We need to
decorate a value with its original type to know whats safe. That may be a good
future project, but I think adding metadata to the runtime is out of scope for
my dissertation.

If lying types != transient and we use a kind of wrappers instead, then we
can make the H <-> L boundary a noop.

      +--[noop]-->  H  <--[wrap]--+
      |                           |
      v                           v
         >-----[noop/wrap]----->
      L                           U
         <-----[scan/wrap]-----<

     Potential, if L creates wrappers

But now we lose the benefits of transient and need to implement a new kind of
wrapper.



update 2019-12-18

Dear committee members,

Since my proposal presentation, I've drafted a new thesis statement, made
progress on the model, and found some library-using programs that run faster
with my Transient prototype.


## draft thesis statement

Honest and lying types can coexist in a way that retains the formal
properties of each and yields measurably significant performance benefits.


## model

I developed a model with:

- three surface languages (honest, lying, untyped)
- one evaluation language
- one surface-to-evaluation compiler that inserts runtime checks

The semantics of the evaluation language does not rely on type or language
information; it simply executes the checks inserted by the compiler.

I have mostly completed the proofs of type soundness (for all 3 surface langs)
and complete monitoring (for honest types).

This model reflects what we can easily implement in the current Racket
implementation --- we can insert runtime checks during compilation,
but we don't yet have a way to attach type & language info to the checks.


## transient, math library

I've found 7 untyped programs (from various Racket packages) that use the typed
math library. When I recompile the math library to use the transient prototype,
these programs get 2x to 30x faster.

I'll keep looking for more case studies like these, and hope to convert some
into full benchmarks.


## next

My next step is to add language information to the runtime checks in the model.
I expect to exploit this information to reduce the number of checks.

A little more precisely, the current model has 3 kinds of check:

1. wrap = check full type and wrap higher-order values
2. scan = check value shape
3. noop = do nothing

The next model will keep these kinds of checks and annotate each check in a
program with two languages. So if H = honest, L = lying, and U = untyped, we
have at least these 6 checks:

1. H -> wrap -> U
2. U -> wrap -> H
3. H -> wrap -> L
4. L -> wrap -> H
5. U -> scan -> L
6. L -> noop -> U

Promises

- change the thesis question to be clearer; articulate the goals & ways it can fail

- find criteria to test whether my implementation of Transient is
  worth measuring (two options so far: compare the overhead to
  Reticulated, and compare the perf. relative to Natural on programs
  where the two should theoretically do the same checks)

- for the evaluation, show the "fixed" modules and how they are typed
  (untyped, N, or T)

- look for additional benchmarks with fixed modules that cannot be typed as-is

- be sure to support & evaluate object-oriented programs

- run a quick experiment on the Math library to see what kind of
  improvement we can expect; find an untyped program that suffers,
  convert the library to Transient, see if the untyped suffering is
  gone, and see what happens if the program is Natural-typed

- rename "honest" & "lying"

Well okay, he too is interested in the semantic types perspective. That makes:
 Ron = type-semantics to get N,T,E operational semantics
 Amal = semantic version of complete monitoring
