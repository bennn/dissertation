Early thoughts on the model, Natural + Transient

- [ ] simple 3-semantics,
  - [X] draft
  - [ ] prove US, TS, CM

Idea (2019-12-04):
---

Can easily collapse Transient and Untyped ... add "nothing" to the model
 and the semantics can run smoothly.

- Need a syntactic boundary for each of the three langs, but the
  semantics shouldn't really need to know whats inside.
